By the quay was an old prison, the kind introduced in the 19th century with individual cells for the inmates, a tradition discontinued in the 1940s.</p>\n<p>As part of <em>Projekt Nattljus</em> (\"Project Night Light\") which ran from 1999 to 2006, the quay was furnished with lighting together with other areas facing the water in the neighbourhood, including Riddarhustorget, Riddarhusgränd, Rådhusgränd and Munkbrohamnen.</p>",
