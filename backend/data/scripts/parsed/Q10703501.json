  "text": "<h1>Triewaldsgränd</h1>\n<p><strong>Triewaldsgränd</strong> (Swedish: \"Alley of Triewalds\") is an alley in Gamla stan, the old town in central Stockholm, Sweden. Stretching south from the square Järntorget to Kornhamnstorg and Munkbroleden, it forms a parallel street to Funckens Gränd and Järntorgsgatan.</p>\n<p>The name is derived from the German farrier and anchor smith Mårten Triewald the Elder who bought a building at number 5 in 1694. He is mostly known through his sons, the captain and mechanic Mårten Triewald the Younger, co-founder of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, and the diplomat and poet Samuel von Triewald. The street is labelled <em>Triwalds gr</em>[<em>änd</em>] on a map dated 1733, but is humorously referred to as <em>Trivialsgränd</em> (\"The Trivial Alley\"), either a paraphrasing of the original name or referring to the block north of Järntorget named <em>Trivia</em>.</p>",
