North and south of the square are the alleys Sven Vintappares Gränd and Didrik Ficks Gränd, both leading to Västerlånggatan and Stora Nygatan.</p>\n<p>Like the neighbouring square Gåstorget situated a block further north and several other small open spaces in the old town, Sven Vintappares Torg, which was its name before 2018, was created during the 18th century as a turning space for horse-drawn vehicles, which was badly needed in the narrow medieval urban throng.</p>\n<p>Presumably, the square remained nameless for many years, before the current name was proposed in 2002.</p>",
