  "text": "<h1>Admiralty House (Stockholm)</h1>\n<p>The <strong>Admiralty House</strong> (Swedish: <em>Amiralitetshuset</em>) is an admiralty house on the islet Skeppsholmen in central Stockholm, Sweden.</p>\n<p>Built in 1647-50 as the Admiralty Board moved over to Skeppsholmen, and probably designed by Louis Gillis, a Dutch architect operating in Stockholm since the 1620s, it was built in a Dutch Renaissance style with stepped gables, much like the present building, but the limestone portal is the only part remaining from this period. In 1680-1750 it was used as an archive, and then as a corn stable until 1794 when rebuilt as a barrack.</p>\n<p>Still used as the latter, it was redesigned in 1844-46 by the architect Fredrik Blom as a Neo-Renaissance building with turrets added on the corners.</p>\n<p>It was rebuilt in 1952 by Rudolf Cronstedt to accommodate the Admiralty again, but today houses the Swedish Institute of International Affairs (<em>Utrikespolitiska institutet</em>, UI).</p>",
