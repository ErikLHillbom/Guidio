  "text": "<h1>Myntgatan</h1>\n<p><strong>Myntgatan</strong> (Swedish: [ˈmʏ̂ntˌɡɑːtan]) is a street in Gamla stan, the old town in central Stockholm, Sweden. Stretching west from Mynttorget over to Riddarhustorget, it is crossed by the streets Salviigränd, Rådhusgränd, Riddarhusgränd, and Storkyrkobrinken.</p>\n<p>Most of the buildings surrounding the street are occupied by either the Parliament or the Supreme Court.</p>\n<h2>History</h2>\n<p>While the square <em>Mynttorget</em> was named for its proximity to the Royal Mint and is present on a map dated 1733 AD, the name of the street <em>Myntgatan</em> is most likely much younger. On a map from the 1630s it is called <em>Skattmestere Gattun</em> (\"Treasurer's Street\"), probably in reference to Gabriel Bengtsson Oxenstierna (1586–1656) who owned a single land parcel by the street. It has also been referred to as Salviigränd.</p>\n<p>Following the completion of Stora Nygatan in the 1660s, it was realized that this new boulevard-like street, a pride for a still largely medieval Stockholm, could not end up blindly in what was then a peripheral end of the city – an insight which led to the gradual creation of Myntgatan which forms a perpendicular angle to Stora Nygatan in the Baroque manner of the era.</p>\n<p>The street was thus extended east to Mynttorget as the latter was created in 1672 and the old defensive tower, <em>Norre port</em>, was demolished. It was then called <em>Riddargatan</em> (\"Knight's Street\") or <em>Riddarhusgatan</em> (\"Knight's House Street\") until the late-19th century in references to Riddarhuset, but apparently different names were used for the eastern and western ends of the street.</p>",
