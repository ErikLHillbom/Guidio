  "text": "<h1>Teater Tribunalen</h1>\n<p><strong>Teater Tribunalen</strong> (commonly known as <em>Tribunalen</em>) is an independent Swedish theatre group in Stockholm.</p>\n<p>The theatre group was founded in 1995 by three recent graduates from the Swedish National Academy of Mime and Acting (\"Scenskolan\") in Malmö: Richard Turpin, Henrik Dahl, and Lars Söderman. They refurbished the old Lido building in Stockholm, which had been previously a porn theatre and then a cultural club, to serve as their venue. Tribunalen's first production was Jean-Paul Sartre's 1959 play <em>The Condemned of Altona.</em> It premiered on 28 October 1995.</p>\n<p>Teater Tribunalen is an outspoken political theatre group interested in influencing the society by challenging politic power, the government and nationally-debated issues with their work.</p>\n<p>In the spring of 2012, Ellen Nyman will direct “A performance of Swedish Arms Exports”( En föreställning om svensk vapenexport) at Teater Tribunalen. The goal is to initiate a national referendum on Swedish arms export.</p>",
