  "text": "<h1>Kungsbron</h1>\n<p><strong>Kungsbron</strong> (Swedish: \"King's Bridge\") is a double bridge in central Stockholm, Sweden. Stretching over Klara Sjö, it connects Norrmalm to Kungsholmen.</p>\n<h2>History</h2>\n<p>In 1881, an old wooden bridge spanning Klara sjö (\"Lake Klara\") was replaced by a 10,7 metres wide steel swing bridge, hand-driven until electricity in 1906 made operation of the bridge three times faster.</p>\n<p>A steel two-hinged arch bridge with a single span of 42 metres was added in 1907 stretching over the older bridge. This second bridge was repaired in 1930-1933 and 1952–1953.</p>\n<p>The swing bridge was replaced in 1944 by two one-way concrete arch bridges, each 14 metres wide with a maximum span of 68 metres.</p>\n<p>The bridge(s) forms the continuation of Kungsgatan (\"The King Street\"), which was given its name in 1881, most likely chosen because it crosses Drottninggatan (\"The Queen Street\"). </p>\n<h2>Gallery</h2>\n<ul><li> Northern bridge viewed from the southern.</li> <li> A pillar supporting the circular pedestrian bridge.</li> <li> Concrete structures on the eastern side.</li></ul>",
