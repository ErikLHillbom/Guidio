The Art Society in Stockholm moved into the premises on 1868. However, Governor Theodore Blanch (1835–1911) opened Blanch's cafe on the ground floor in July 1868. The interior was elegant and airy, with crystal chandeliers, plush carpets and comfortable chairs.</p>\n<p>Live music was played every afternoon and foreign newspapers were laid out in the dining room. The building was replaced in the 1960s by Sverigehuset (Sweden House).</p>",
