Södermalm borough has a population of around 110,000, making it the most populated borough of Stockholm. The urban development project of Hammarby Sjöstad is located in the Södermalm borough.</p>\n<h2>Overview</h2>\n<p>Södermalm was created 1 January 2007, through the merging of the boroughs of Maria-Gamla Stan and Katarina-Sofia. It covers the island of Södermalm and some neighboring districts. The two former boroughs made up the eastern and western half of the island of Södermalm. Maria-Gamla Stan was the result of a previous merging between the original borough with the same name, and the former borough of Hornstull, in 1999. Maria-Gamla Stan also included the island districts of Gamla Stan, Långholmen, Reimersholme, Riddarholmen and Årsta holmar; Katarina-Sofia included the district Södra Hammarbyhamnen south of Södermalm. All these districts are now parts of the new Södermalm borough.</p>\n<h2>Gallery</h2>\n<ul><li> Modern building in Hammarby Sjöstad</li> <li> Riddarholmen</li> <li> Street in Gamla stan</li> <li> The South Tower, adjacent to Medborgarplatsen in the center of Södermalm</li></ul>",
