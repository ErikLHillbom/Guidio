In 1796 such a space was created on the present location. Though the square was not given an official name, it was informally referred to as <em>Gåsplan</em> (\"Goose Plain\") or <em>Gåsgtorget</em>. A 1981 proposal to name the square after the troubadour Evert Taube was rejected, and the common name was made official.</p>\n<h2>Sculpture</h2>\n<p>On the square is a one metre tall bronze sculpture on a granite base, <em>Tungviktare</em> (\"Heavyweights\") from 1967 by the sculptor Sven Lundqvist.</p>",
