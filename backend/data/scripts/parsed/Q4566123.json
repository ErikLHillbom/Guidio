Stretching from Västerlånggatan to Stora Nygatan, it forms a parallel street to Kåkbrinken and Skräddargränd.</p>\n<h2>History</h2>\n<p>The alley is named after the merchant Jean Bedoire the Younger (1683–1753) who for some time ruled the Swedish salt market and became the proprietor of the narrow block <em>Parcas</em> north of the alley in 1707 when he married Maria Juliana Paradis, the widow of wine trader Conrad Cuyper who had used the block as a wine storage. Jean Bedoire successfully developed the business of his father and namesake by exporting iron and salt and as a banker, including kings such as Charles XII and Frederick I among his customers. He died in 1753, leaving a fortune of 5,700,000 copper riksdaler behind. (See also 7, Stortorget.) The shutters on the building date from this era, as does the unassuming Rococo portal of Number 2.</p>\n<p>The name first appears on a map dated 1733. The alley is mentioned in 1581 as <em>Lille Brynhilz grändh</em> (\"Smaller Alley of Bryniel\").</p>",
