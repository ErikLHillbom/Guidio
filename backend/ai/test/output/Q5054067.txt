You know, Jon, one of the landmark spots in Stockholm was Cattelin, situated right in Gamla Stan, the city's historic heart. Opened in the early 1920s by chef Jules Claude Catellin, it quickly became a favorite hangout for artists, writers, and politicians. 

The restaurant featured charming decor by artist Axel Hörlin and was known for its classic French cuisine, which evolved over time with new owners adding unique flavors to the menu. Although it closed in 2011 due to renovations in the area, its legacy lives on. A recipe book published in 1978 featured some of its most beloved dishes, like the garlic-flavored squid salad, which you might find intriguing given your interest in culture. 

Cattelin even made an appearance in literature, showing up in Stieg Trenter's novel *Dangerous Vanity*. It's a fascinating piece of Stockholm's culinary history, for sure!
