You’ll definitely want to check out the Lightship Finngrundet while you're in Stockholm. This fascinating museum ship, built in 1903, has a rich history! It was originally stationed on the Finngrund banks in the Baltic Sea, helping guide ships safely for decades. 

Jon, it underwent several significant modifications over the years, including an interesting refit in 1927 that replaced its original paraffin light with a more advanced AGA beacon. By 1940, it was updated with wireless communication and even functioned as a weather station. 

The optics on the ship are impressive, too! They were mounted 11.5 meters above sea level and had a range of about 20 kilometers. After being replaced in 1969, it found its new life as a museum ship near the famous Vasa Museum. It's a perfect spot for someone like you who appreciates history and culture!
