You know, Jon, if you’re interested in history, you might find Eldkvarn quite fascinating. This grand gristmill, built back in 1805, was a crucial part of Stockholm’s flour production. Imagine the hustle and bustle there in the 19th century! 

But the real tale of Eldkvarn is its dramatic end—the fire of 1878, dubbed "the fire of the century." It lit up the night sky and was so intense that people across the city were captivated by it. The fire reportedly started small when a gas lamp fell, but it spread rapidly, creating a spectacle that gripped the entire city. 

Even though the fire was ferocious, they managed to save some parts of the mill, and it continued operating until 1906. It’s incredible to think about how a single event like that could leave such a mark on Stockholm's history, right?
