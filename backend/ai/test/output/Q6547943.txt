Have you heard about Lilla Hoparegränd, Jon? It’s a charming little alley right in Gamla stan, the historical heart of Stockholm. This alley runs between Skeppsbron and Österlånggatan and is parallel to other quaint streets like Ferkens Gränd and Gaffelgränd.

What’s interesting is its history; it’s been around since at least the 16th century. Originally called "Varggränd," which translates to "Wolf Alley," the exact reason for that name is a bit of a mystery. The current name, Lilla Hoparegränd, likely honors someone named Michel Hoper, who may have had ties to the barrel-making trade. 

Exploring such historical spots really gives you a taste of the culture here, doesn’t it?
