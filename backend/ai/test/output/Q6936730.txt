Munkbrohamnen is a fascinating spot, Jon! This quay along Gamla stan's waterfront offers a lovely footpath and stunning views of Riddarfjärden. It's not just any ordinary place; the name was officially adopted in 1921, but it has a rich history tied to the boats that once docked here and the nearby Greyfriars abbey.

You can easily access it from the old town's metro station, making it a perfect stop for anyone interested in Stockholm’s history and culture. Plus, walking along this waterfront gives you a unique perspective on the city’s historical architecture against the backdrop of the bay. It's definitely worth a visit while you're exploring!
