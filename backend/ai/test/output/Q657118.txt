You know, Riddarholmen Church is quite a fascinating spot in Stockholm. It’s steeped in history, being the former Greyfriars Monastery, and it’s the final resting place for many Swedish monarchs, from Gustavus Adolphus to Gustaf V—except for Queen Christina, who’s in Rome.

The church itself showcases a mix of architectural styles, mostly Northern European Gothic, with some Baroque elements sprinkled in. You’ll notice parts of it date back to the late 13th century, giving it an impressive historical depth. 

Interestingly, after the Protestant Reformation, it transformed from a monastery to a Lutheran church. And did you know that when a knight of the Royal Order of the Seraphim passes away, their coat of arms is displayed there? The church bells ring continuously from noon to 1 PM during such funerals. It's a beautiful blend of history and culture, perfect for your interests, Jon!
