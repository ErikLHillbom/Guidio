Ah, Serafimerlasarettet, or Serafen as it's affectionately known, is quite a fascinating piece of history here in Stockholm. Established in 1752, it was the first modern hospital in Sweden and operated all the way until 1980. Can you believe it? The building still serves a purpose today, housing the local emergency department.

It’s also a spot touched by culture; the poet Carl Michael Bellman referenced it in his 1790 songs, weaving it into the fabric of Stockholm's history. If you're wandering around Kungsholmen, keep an eye out for the original hospital gate from 1792—it's a lovely nod to the past. Exploring places like Serafen really gives you a sense of the city's rich history, wouldn’t you agree?
