You’ll definitely want to check out Saint George and the Dragon while you're in Stockholm, Jon. This impressive late medieval wooden sculpture is located in Storkyrkan and was created by Bernt Notke, a renowned artist of the time. Commissioned by Sten Sture the Elder after a significant victory over the Danish army, it was inaugurated back in 1489.

What’s fascinating is the sculpture’s symbolism. It not only represents the legendary battle between Saint George and the dragon but also served as a political statement and a funerary monument for Sture himself. The saint's plume is in Swedish colors, blue and yellow, tying it to national pride.

The sculpture stands about 6 meters tall and depicts Saint George valiantly battling the dragon, with intricate details like human bones scattered around and even baby dragons peeking out. Notke used various materials, from oak to elk antlers, which adds to its uniqueness.

It’s a true artistic high point of the Northern Renaissance and really captures the essence of the time. If you’re into history and culture, this is definitely a piece you shouldn’t miss!
