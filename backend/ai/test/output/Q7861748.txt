You’d really enjoy wandering down Tyska Brinken, Jon. This charming street in Gamla stan has a rich history tied to the German community in Stockholm. Originally known by names like "Water Slope" in the 15th century, it eventually became Tyska Brinken around the late 17th century, reflecting its proximity to the German Church.

As you stroll, you’ll notice how the area was significant during the Middle Ages, with many German merchants shaping the city’s culture and trade. The street intersects with several other quaint lanes, making it a delightful spot to explore. Plus, if you're into archaeology, there’s even evidence of a 14th-century city wall nearby!

The architecture here is also quite striking, particularly the Rococo-style building of the German Church, which was crafted by merging several medieval properties. It's a perfect blend of history and culture that I think you'll find captivating!
