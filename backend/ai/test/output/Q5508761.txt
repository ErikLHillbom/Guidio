Ah, Funckens Gränd is a fascinating little alley tucked away in Gamla stan, the historic heart of Stockholm. It runs south from Västerlånggatan to Kornhamnstorg, creating a charming pathway through the old town. The name comes from the Funck family, who were prominent in the area during the 17th century, and it’s interesting to think about how much history this narrow street has seen since it first appeared in records back in 1666.

As you stroll down, you’ll notice a mix of architectural styles, with buildings that have undergone numerous reconstructions over the centuries. One notable spot is the former residence of the Funck family, which has a rich history tied to the alley. If you enjoy history and culture, Jon, this little alley offers a glimpse into the everyday life of Stockholm's past. Plus, the surrounding area is just brimming with cafes and shops, perfect for soaking in the atmosphere. What do you think?
