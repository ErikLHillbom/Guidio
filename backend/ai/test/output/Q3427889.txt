You know, Jon, Katarina Parish has quite a fascinating history! It’s located in Södermalm, in the heart of Stockholm, and was established back in the 17th century. The original wooden chapel was built on a site that has a rather somber history, where the corpse of Sten Sture the Younger was burned after the tragic events of the Stockholm Bloodbath in 1520.

The actual church, which is the centerpiece of the parish, was consecrated in 1671 and rebuilt after a fire in 1723. It features a unique dome surrounded by small towers, marking it as one of Stockholm’s first central churches. 

If you’re interested in culture, the interior of the church was vividly decorated in the 1890s, making it quite a visual treat. Plus, there’s a memorial to Sten Sture the Younger in the cemetery, which adds an intriguing historical layer to the experience. The area surrounding the parish is vibrant, with Medborgarplatsen right in the middle, making it a great spot to explore!
