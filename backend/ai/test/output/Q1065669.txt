Kastellholmen, which translates to "The Castle Isle," is a charming islet right in the heart of Stockholm. It’s part of the Skeppsholmen district and is easily accessible via the Kastellholmsbron bridge, connecting it to the neighboring islet. 

What’s really interesting, Jon, is that it features a small castle called Kastellet, built between 1846 and 1848 by architect Fredrik Blom. The island has had several names over the years, including Notholmen and Lilla Beckholmen, which gives it a rich historical background. It's managed by the Swedish National Property Agency and is part of the Royal National City Park, making it a lovely spot for a bit of history and culture amidst nature.
