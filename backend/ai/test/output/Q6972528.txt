You know, while you're exploring Stockholm, you might find the Swedish National Export Credits Guarantee Board, or EKN, quite interesting. It’s a government agency that plays a pivotal role in promoting Swedish exports. By issuing guarantees, it essentially provides insurance, allowing businesses to take on risks more confidently. 

Located right here in the city, it answers to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. So, if you're keen on the economic history and how Sweden supports its businesses globally, Jon, this agency is certainly a noteworthy part of that narrative!
