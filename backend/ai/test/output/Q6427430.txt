You’ve got to check out Kolmätargränd while you’re in Gamla Stan, Jon! It’s a charming little alley that connects Västerlånggatan to Brantingtorget, and it has quite the history. 

Named after Hans Kohlmeter, a magistrate from the 17th century, this alley has also been referenced in literature, particularly by the famous troubadour Carl Michael Bellman. His song about a fire in Kolmätargränd is a staple in Swedish culture, humorously depicting the chaos of the event. 

Interestingly, its length was altered during World War II due to an expansion project, leading to what’s casually referred to as the "Battle of Kolmätargränd." It's a perfect spot to soak up some local history and culture, all while enjoying the quaint surroundings!
