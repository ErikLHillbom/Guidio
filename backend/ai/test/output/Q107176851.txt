You know, Jon, if you're looking for a thrilling experience in Stockholm, you have to check out Monster at Gröna Lund. This inverted roller coaster is quite the engineering feat, being the park's largest investment ever at about 450 million Swedish krona. 

Opened just in June 2021, Monster took years to develop, and it even required redesigning a third of the park. It’s fascinating how they managed to fit such a massive attraction in a limited space, with the station built underground to save ground-level area for other attractions. 

The ride itself is a rush! It starts with a steep lift hill and then drops into a super exciting zero-g roll, followed by two inversions and some intense turns. You’ll hit speeds of nearly 56 mph, all while enjoying some beautiful views of the waterfront.

If you're into the history of amusement parks, it's interesting to note that Gröna Lund has a long history since its opening in 1883, making it a cultural landmark as well. Monster is just the latest chapter in that story, blending history with thrilling modern technology. Can't wait for you to experience it!
