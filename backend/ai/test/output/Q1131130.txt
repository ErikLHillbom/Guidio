You know, Jon, if you're exploring Stockholm, St. Eugenia's Church is definitely worth a visit. This Roman Catholic church was built in 1982 and is nestled right next to the former Royal Gardens, Kungsträdgården, in the heart of the city. It’s quite interesting that its design comes from Danish architect Jørgen Kjaergaard.

What makes it even more special is that it’s dedicated to Saint Eugenia, an abbess from the 8th century in France. This place has deep historical roots, being the oldest Catholic parish in Sweden since the Reformation, with services offered in multiple languages.

Though it might not stand out from the outside due to its location within a historic building, the interior has some fascinating details. You’ll find beautiful items that date back to its predecessor, like the neo-baroque baptismal font and even a monumental wooden cross. Plus, the foundation stone was a gift from Pope Paul VI, sourced from St. Peter's Basilica in Rome. 

So, if you’re into history and culture, Jon, this spot will certainly pique your interest!
