So, if you're interested in history and culture, Kungsträdgården metro station is definitely a spot to check out, Jon. Located in Norrmalm, this station opened in 1977 and is the end point for lines 10 and 11. What’s fascinating is that it's about 34 meters underground and showcases relics from the buildings that were demolished during Stockholm's redevelopment in the mid-20th century.

Also, it has some unique flora and fauna! You might find the rare Lessertia dentichelis spider clinging to the walls, along with moss that was thought to be extinct in the area. Scientists even discovered new fungi species here. It’s quite a rich blend of history and nature! Plus, if you’re a music fan, this spot also featured in a music video by Ace of Base back in the '90s. Definitely a blend of the old and new!
