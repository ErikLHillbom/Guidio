You know, Jon, if you find yourself wandering through Gamla stan, be sure to check out Skeppar Olofs Gränd. This charming little alley stretches from Köpmangatan to Trädgårdsgatan and has quite the historical significance. 

It dates back to at least 1587 and is named after Olof Eriksson, a notable skipper who played a key role in establishing the Swedish Navy under King Gustav Vasa. He was quite the figure—master shipbuilder, naval commander, and an influential merchant in Stockholm. Interestingly, he's buried in the nearby cathedral, which he helped save from demolition.

While you're there, look out for a memorial tile dedicated to Sara Wacklin, a writer and teacher who called this alley home in the 19th century. She’s remembered for her poignant reflections on war and its consequences. It's a great spot to soak in a bit of history and culture right in the heart of the old town!
