You’ll definitely want to check out Kungstornen while you’re in Stockholm, Jon. These twin skyscrapers, known as Norra Kungstornet and Södra Kungstornet, are quite an iconic sight. Built in the early 20th century, they’re considered the first modern skyscrapers in Europe. 

The Norra Kungstornet stands 60 meters tall and was constructed between 1919 and 1924, while the slightly taller Södra Kungstornet reached 61 meters and was completed a year later. They were inspired by the architecture of New York's Lower Manhattan, which is fascinating given their historical context. 

You'll notice they sit at a slight bend in the street near Hötorget, showcasing a unique design that reflects the era's ambition. It’s a perfect spot to appreciate both the history and the cultural significance of Stockholm’s architectural evolution.
