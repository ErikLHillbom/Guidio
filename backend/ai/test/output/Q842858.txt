You know, Jon, if you're interested in history and culture, the Nationalmuseum in Stockholm is definitely a must-visit. This national gallery of fine arts is tucked away on the scenic peninsula of Blasieholmen. It was founded way back in 1792, and the building itself was completed in 1866, showcasing striking northern Italian Renaissance architecture.

Inside, you'll find an impressive collection of around 700,000 objects, including notable works by artists like Rembrandt and Renoir. The museum also boasts the world's largest collection of portrait miniatures, which is pretty fascinating. 

After a significant renovation that wrapped up in 2018, the space now offers much more room for exhibitions and has been modernized to showcase these incredible artworks better. It truly is a blend of history, art, and preservation—all elements that I think you'll enjoy exploring.
