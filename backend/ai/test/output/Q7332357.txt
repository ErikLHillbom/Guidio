Riddarhuskajen is such an interesting spot, Jon! This quay is nestled in Gamla stan, Stockholm's charming old town. It runs from the corner of Stadsholmen island towards the Vasabron bridge and the alley Riddarhusgränd. 

What’s fascinating is the history behind the House of Knights, which is just nearby. It was completed in 1870 and reflects the changing power of the Swedish nobility. It’s hard to believe that this area once had a row of humble hovels and a harbor surrounded by wooden palings! 

The name "Riddarhuskajen" was officially adopted in 1925, adding to the rich tapestry of history that you can feel as you walk along this quay. If you're keen on exploring more about the local culture and history, this spot is definitely worth a visit!
