You know, Jon, the Royal Seminary in Stockholm is quite a fascinating piece of history. Established in 1861, it was the first public institution in Sweden specifically for higher education for women. It really played a pivotal role in the advancement of women's rights, especially after the debate sparked by Fredrika Bremer’s novel, *Hertha*, which called for women's educational opportunities.

This seminary trained female teachers for public schools, offering a range of subjects from natural sciences to pedagogy. How amazing is it that at a time when women had limited rights, this institution emerged as a beacon for female education? It operated until 1943, becoming a cornerstone in the development of women's access to higher learning.

Plus, it had a notable feeder program—the Royal Normal School for Girls—which prepared students for this advanced training. Many prominent figures in Swedish literature and education, like Selma Lagerlöf, passed through its halls. It’s incredible how much influence this place had on both education and culture in Sweden, wouldn’t you agree?
