You know, Jon, if you’re interested in history and culture, St. Clare's Priory is definitely a fascinating spot to hear about. Founded in 1289, this Roman Catholic nunnery of the Poor Clares was quite significant in Stockholm until the Swedish Reformation in 1527. 

What’s intriguing is how it wasn’t just for the elite. Many of the nuns came from the merchant class, giving it a unique social fabric. King Magnus Ladulås even donated lands to it, and his daughter served as abbess at one point! The priory had a close relationship with the Grey Friar's Abbey, and there’s even a legend about a secret passage between the two.

Despite enjoying prestige and exemptions from taxes, the nunnery faced challenges, especially after a fire in 1446. The last abbess, Anna Leuhusen, became infamous for her actions during the Swedish War of Liberation, which ultimately contributed to the nunnery's dissolution in 1527. The stones from the priory were used to fortify the city walls, and today, you’d find Klara Church sitting on that very site.

It’s a remarkable piece of history that highlights the complexities of its time!
