You’ll find Prästgården on Skeppsholmen, a charming islet in central Stockholm. It’s quite a historical gem! Originally built in the 1730s, this structure started as a tavern for workers, affectionately nicknamed "Stenkrogen." By the 1840s, it transitioned to classrooms and even served as barracks for the naval reserve.

In the 1920s, it was renovated to become the residence for the naval station's priest and now includes a lovely chapel and garden. Today, it’s part of the Moderna Museet, where you can enjoy its sculptural park. It sounds like a perfect spot for someone like you, Jon, who appreciates history and culture!
