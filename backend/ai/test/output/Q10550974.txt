In Gamla Stan, right by Skeppsbron, you’ll find the Glaucus Block, which is steeped in history, Jon. This area dates back to the late 1200s and features remnants of S:t Johanneskyrkan, a monastery established in the 1500s by the Knights Hospitaller. It’s fascinating how this block evolved; the church was eventually demolished after the Reformation.

You’ll also notice two notable buildings from the 1600s, the Brandenburgska huset and Hebbeska huset. Brandenburgska huset, located at the corner of Skeppsbron and Gaffelgränd, has a charming medieval-inspired facade added during a renovation in the 1890s. Meanwhile, Hebbeska huset has a rich 18th-century history and was named after the family that owned it for many years. 

The whole block is recognized for its cultural significance, and Gamla Stan is classified as a national heritage reserve. If you’re intrigued by the layers of history here, it’s definitely worth a stroll!
