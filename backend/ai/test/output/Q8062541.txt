You've got to check out Yxsmedsgränd when you're wandering through Gamla stan, Jon. This charming alley has a rich history that dates back to the early 17th century. It runs parallel to Didrik Ficks Gränd and Kåkbrinken, and is easily accessible from Västerlånggatan and Stora Nygatan.

What's fascinating about Yxsmedsgränd is how its name has evolved over the years. Originally referenced as "Yskemes grenden," it seems to have connections to a figure named Jöran Yskemes, who lived in the area. The name also hints at some intriguing linguistic roots, possibly even Estonian or Finnish!

And if you enjoy literature, you'll appreciate that this alley is mentioned in Carl Michael Bellman's song "Fredman's Epistle," where the muse Ulla Winblad makes a memorable escape. It’s a lovely spot to soak up the atmosphere and imagine the stories that have unfolded there over centuries!
