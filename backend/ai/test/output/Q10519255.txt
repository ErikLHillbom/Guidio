You’ll find Hedvig Eleonora Parish nestled within Östermalm's church district in Stockholm. This charming parish was established back in 1672, originally named after the Holmkyrkan Parish. It’s fascinating how it has undergone several name changes over the years, including its previous title as Ladugårdsland Parish. 

The centerpiece of the parish is the Hedvig Eleonora Church, which dates back to 1669 and is actually Östermalm's oldest church. Inaugurated in 1737, this beautiful building is right at Östermalm square, where you can also check out Östermalmshallen and the Royal Stables.

What’s really interesting for you, Jon, is that this area is rich in history, having served as the main church until the early 1900s when the district divided into three separate parishes. So, if you’re keen on history and culture, this spot offers a wonderful glimpse into Stockholm's past!
