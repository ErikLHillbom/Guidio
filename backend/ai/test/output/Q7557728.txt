You’ll love exploring Solgränd, Jon! This charming alley in Gamla stan, known as "Sun Alley," connects the bustling Stortorget square to Prästgatan. It's a quaint spot that has a rich history, dating back to the time when several taverns named "Solen" thrived in the area. 

The famous troubadour Carl Michael Bellman even referenced Solgränd in his lyrics, which adds a delightful cultural touch. It’s not just a passageway; it’s a glimpse into the past of Stockholm's old town. Strolling through here, you can almost feel the echoes of history surrounding you.
