You know, Jon, the 1912 Summer Olympics in Stockholm were quite significant, especially for athletics. They featured 30 events, all for men, and it marked the introduction of some interesting competitions. For instance, the 5000 and 10,000 metre races made their debut, while the classic 5-mile event was dropped. 

One unique aspect was that the 400-metre hurdles weren't held that year, making it a rare occurrence since the event's introduction in 1900. Plus, the decathlon returned after a brief absence, and the pentathlon was introduced for the first time. 

The competitions took place over just over a week, from July 6 to July 15, 1912, and involved 556 athletes from 27 nations, with Egypt being the only country that didn’t participate in athletics. It's fascinating how these early Olympics shaped the future of competitive sports!
