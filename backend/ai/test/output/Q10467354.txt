Have you seen The Four Elements, Jon? It’s a stunning mobile sculpture by Alexander Calder, created back in 1961. Standing about 30 feet tall, it features four colorful metal sheets that are motorized and move gracefully. 

What's interesting is that it was initially part of an exhibition called Movement in Art at the Moderna Museet in Stockholm, which ran in 1961. After the exhibition, the sculpture became a permanent fixture outside the museum, essentially becoming a symbol of the Moderna Museet itself. 

If you’re exploring the area, it's definitely worth a visit, especially with its impressive size and vibrant colors!
