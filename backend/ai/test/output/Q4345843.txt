You’ll definitely want to check out the Branting Monument while you’re in Stockholm, Jon. It’s a striking tribute to Hjalmar Branting, a key figure in Swedish social democracy. The monument stands 5 meters tall and 6 meters wide, making quite an impression in Norra Bantorget, a park that’s historically significant for the Social Democratic movement.

The statue, crafted by Carl Eldh, captures Branting passionately addressing a crowd of workers during a May Day demonstration. Among the anonymous workers are notable pioneers of the labor movement, which adds a layer of history to the scene. 

Interestingly, the monument has a bit of a troubled past too. In 1992, it was damaged by a bomb, but luckily it was restored a couple of years later. It’s a fascinating piece of Stockholm’s cultural landscape that really embodies the spirit of the labor movement in Sweden.
