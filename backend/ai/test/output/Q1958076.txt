Oh, you’re going to find Mörby centrum quite fascinating, Jon! This shopping mall, located in Danderyd, just north of Stockholm, has a rich history. It was originally built in 1961 by the architects Fors & Son and has evolved over the years, transforming into an indoor shopping experience in 1977. 

Interestingly, it’s not just a place to shop; there's also a Stockholm Metro station right there, making it quite accessible. So, if you're interested in both history and culture, it’s a great spot to explore the blend of modern retail and architectural development that reflects the growth of the area.
