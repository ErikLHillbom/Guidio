You’ll love exploring Skräddargränd, Jon! This charming little alley in Gamla stan, or the old town, really embodies Stockholm’s history. It runs from Västerlånggatan to Stora Nygatan and is known as "Tailor's Alley" because it was home to the tailor's guild from 1627 until 1842. 

Imagine walking down a street that was once bustling with tailors crafting garments for the city. The name "Bredgränd," or "Wide Alley," was used back in the 15th century, hinting at its slightly larger width compared to other narrow alleys nearby. Plus, part of the building once housed a tavern, the Förgylta Drufvan, which had royal sanction from King Gustavus Adolphus. It’s a perfect spot for a quick stroll, steeped in history and culture!
