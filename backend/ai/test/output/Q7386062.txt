You know, Rådhusgränd is this charming little alley right in the heart of Gamla stan, the old town of Stockholm. It connects Myntgatan with Riddarhustorget and runs between the impressive Bonde Palace and the Kanslihuset, or Chancellery House. It leads you north toward the bridge Vasabron, making it a nice stroll if you’re interested in exploring the area’s historical architecture.

The Bonde Palace itself has a fascinating history, originally built in the 17th century and even serving as the Town House for a while. Imagine, it was closed off for quite some time to accommodate a prison! And now, right next to it, you’ll find the Kanslihuset, which has a distinctive façade adorned with a limestone frieze that adds a touch of artistic flair. It's a perfect spot for someone like you, Jon, who appreciates history and culture.
