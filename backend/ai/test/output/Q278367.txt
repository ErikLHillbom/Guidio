You know, Jon, one of the most fascinating things about Stockholm is its unique geography. The city is spread across fourteen islands, where Lake Mälaren meets the Baltic Sea. This gives the entire city a stunning waterfront vibe, making it feel almost like it's floating on water, especially in the city center.

As you explore, you'll notice the historical significance of these islands. Each one has its own character, from the vibrant Djurgården, which boasts parks and museums, to the charming streets of Gamla Stan, the old town. It’s like walking through a living museum! 

Stockholm's terrain is equally intriguing, shaped by ancient geological processes that created low-lying plateaus. This mix of water, islands, and geological history not only defines the city’s beauty but also its culture and history. Just imagine the stories these waters could tell!
