You know, Jon, if you're interested in a modern piece of Stockholm's infrastructure, you should check out Stockholm City station. Opened in 2017, it’s quite a recent addition to the city’s transport network, located right beneath T-Centralen, which is the main hub of the metro system.

What’s impressive is that this station is the busiest railway station in Sweden! It connects seamlessly with the Stockholm Central Station and serves almost all commuter rail routes. The design features a glass facade that lets in natural light, making the environment down there a bit brighter than you might expect for a station lying between 35 and 40 meters underground.

Interestingly, the construction of the station began back in 2009, and it represents a significant advancement in making travel more efficient across the city. If you find yourself in the area, it’s a fascinating spot to observe how modern engineering blends into the historical backdrop of Stockholm!
