You’re going to find the Blue Hall quite fascinating, Jon! This is the main hall of the Stockholm City Hall and it’s renowned for hosting the prestigious annual Nobel Banquet every December 10th. Imagine a gathering filled with the Swedish royal family and over 1200 distinguished guests—definitely a cultural highlight!

What’s interesting is that the hall has brick walls that were originally meant to be plastered and painted blue, reflecting the water of the bay. However, the architect Ragnar Östberg embraced the red brick instead, and the name "Blue Hall" stuck around.

The space itself is quite impressive, measuring about 50 meters long and featuring a monumental staircase and a grand balcony. And if you’re into music, you’ll appreciate that it houses Scandinavia's second largest pipe organ, which has around 10,000 pipes!

So, if you have some time in your itinerary, visiting the Blue Hall would certainly enrich your experience of Stockholm's history and culture!
