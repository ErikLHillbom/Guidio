Munkbroleden is quite an interesting spot in the heart of Gamla stan, Jon. This busy street runs along the western waterfront and connects several notable squares, including Kornhamnstorg and Mälartorget. It stretches from Slussen to Riddarhustorget, making it a significant thoroughfare in the old town.

Historically, the name comes from the Greyfriars abbey that used to be on Riddarholmen, and it’s often called Munkbron by locals, which refers to the square nearby. The street was originally created in 1930 to handle increasing traffic and had a fascinating history with the Stenborg Theatre, which was there until 1799. It's a great area to soak in the culture and history of Stockholm!
