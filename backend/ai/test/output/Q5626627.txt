Have you ever wandered through Gamla Stan, Jon? If you do, make sure to check out Göran Hälsinges Gränd. This charming alley connects Västerlånggatan to Stora Nygatan and has a rich history. 

It's named after Göran Hälsinge, who, interestingly, is not exactly a household name. The alley’s story goes back to the 16th century, when his mother, Appolonia Larsdotter, was rewarded with a house there for her service as a wet nurse to the royal family. 

You might find it intriguing that the alley has ties to some colorful aspects of history, including references to it being associated with prostitution in the 18th century. So, while you're exploring, you’re not just walking through a picturesque alley; you’re stepping into a little slice of Stockholm's past!
