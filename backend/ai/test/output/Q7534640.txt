You’ll love exploring Skeppar Karls Gränd while you’re in Gamla stan, Jon. This charming alley runs from Skeppsbron to Österlånggatan and is rich in history. It was named after a skipper who owned property there back in 1564, which gives it a fascinating historical vibe.

Interestingly, it was mentioned as early as 1569 and had a few name changes over the years, including a brief stint as "First Mate Alley." There’s even a tower in the city wall named after the same skipper from 1581! It’s a perfect spot to soak in some culture and feel the history of Stockholm. What do you think?
