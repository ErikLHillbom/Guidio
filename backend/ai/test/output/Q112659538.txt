You know, Jon, if you’re interested in history and culture, the Lenin Monument April 13th 1917 is definitely worth checking out. This intriguing public art installation by Swedish artist Björn Lövin can be found right outside the Moderna Museet on Skeppsholmen. 

What makes this piece unique is that it doesn't glorify Lenin like most monuments do. Instead, it uses a cross-mark to indicate his presence in a famous photograph from 1917, taken as he arrived in Stockholm. It’s more of a “nonument,” challenging the way we think about historical significance. The artwork really prompts you to question what we choose to remember collectively, which I think is pretty fascinating. 

Plus, it’s sparked quite a bit of debate over the years, with some considering it controversial due to Lenin's complex legacy. It’s a thought-provoking spot that ties together history, art, and cultural reflection, and I think you’d appreciate the deeper conversation it invites!
