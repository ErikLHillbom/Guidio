If you’re interested in history and culture, you might find Teater Tribunalen quite fascinating! This independent theatre group in Stockholm has been making waves since it was founded in 1995 by three graduates from the Swedish National Academy of Mime and Acting. They transformed an old venue, which had a colorful past as both a porn theatre and a cultural club, into a space for powerful performances.

Their first production was Sartre's poignant play *The Condemned of Altona*, and since then, they’ve been known for their outspoken political stance. They aim to provoke thought and influence societal issues through their art. For example, a notable project in 2012 focused on initiating a national referendum regarding Swedish arms exports. It’s a unique blend of culture and activism that Jon might find really compelling!
