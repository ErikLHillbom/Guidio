You’ll find Tyghuset on Skeppsholmen, a fascinating piece of history in central Stockholm. Originally built in 1663 for the Swedish Navy, it was designed as a rope walk—an essential structure for making ropes. It's interesting to note that this building took a decade to complete but only four years before it suffered a fire. After various uses, including stabling horses and even housing exotic animals for a brief period, it eventually became the Museum of Far Eastern Antiquities in 1963.

Jon, the blend of its military past and its current role as a museum really highlights the rich cultural tapestry of this area. If you’re into history, walking through Tyghuset gives you a unique glimpse into Stockholm's maritime heritage.
