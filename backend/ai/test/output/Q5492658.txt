You know, Jon, if you’re into history and culture, you might want to check out Frantzén while you're in Stockholm. This restaurant has quite an impressive story! It opened in 2008 at Klara Norra Kyrkogata and quickly made a name for itself. By 2009, it earned its first Michelin star, and just a year later, it had two stars. 

What's really fascinating is that it became the first Swedish restaurant to achieve three Michelin stars in 2018, which is a big deal! The chef, Björn Frantzén, initially opened the spot with pastry chef Daniel Lindeberg, but they parted ways in 2013. After a year-long closure for renovations, Frantzén reopened in a much larger space, allowing for an even more exciting dining experience.

So, if you're looking for a taste of fine dining with a rich history, Frantzén could be a perfect stop for you!
