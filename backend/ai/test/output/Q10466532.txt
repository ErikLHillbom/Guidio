You’ll love the Daneliuska huset, Jon! This unique building, often called Strykjärnshuset, is located in the vibrant Östermalm district of Stockholm. Its striking wedge shape and steeply pitched conical tower make it stand out among the city’s architectural gems.

Constructed between 1898 and 1900, the Daneliuska huset was designed by architect Erik Josephson, inspired by the grand Renaissance castles he admired in France. The richly decorated limestone facade showcases intricate sculptures, including putti and animal heads, which add a lively charm to the building.

It’s fascinating to note that this building is blue-marked by the City Museum of Stockholm, highlighting its exceptional cultural-historical significance. Originally built for luxury apartments, it was home to Bror August Danelius, a wealthy salmon wholesaler, and his family. The lavish interiors once featured stunning murals, tiled stoves, and ample rooms for entertaining.

Throughout its history, the Daneliuska huset has faced challenges, including a threat of demolition in the 1960s, but thanks to passionate local advocates, it remains a treasured part of Stockholm’s architectural landscape. If you get a chance, definitely check it out while you're here!
