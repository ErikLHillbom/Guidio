You know, Jon, if you find yourself strolling through Stockholm, Arsenalsgatan is definitely worth a visit. This charming street is located on the Blasieholmen peninsula and runs through the lively Blasieholmstorg area. What’s great is that it’s partly pedestrianised, making it a lovely spot to enjoy the city’s vibe. It’s a nice blend of history and culture, right in the heart of the city. Perfect for a leisurely walk!
