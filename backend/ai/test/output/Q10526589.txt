You know, if you're exploring Södermalm, you might want to check out the Scandic Hotel Malmen. It’s a fascinating spot with a rich cultural history. Built between 1948 and 1951, this hotel replaced the historic Stora Teatern, once Stockholm's largest film theatre.

The design reflects classic modernist architecture, created by designers Georg Varhelyi and Carl-Axel Acking, who really made the most of the space with its unique room layouts. The characteristic blue-gray details on the facade have been preserved over the years, giving it a nice touch of charm.

Interestingly, Malmen has been part of Scandic Hotels since 2009, and it even hosted the founding meeting of the Federation of International Bandy back in 1955! With its blend of history and culture, it’s a great place to appreciate some local heritage while you’re in the area.
