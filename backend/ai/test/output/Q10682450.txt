So, if you’re exploring Stockholm's nightlife, you have to check out Sturecompagniet. It’s one of the biggest and most famous nightclubs in Sweden, located in a historic building that dates back to the 1800s at Sturegatan 4, right in the heart of Stureplan. 

Beyond just dancing, it has a rich history, although it’s not without its darker moments, like the notorious mass murder that took place there in 1994. It offers a unique blend of contemporary culture and historical intrigue, which I think you'll find fascinating, Jon. Plus, with other popular spots like Hell's Kitchen and IV nearby, it’s definitely a vibrant area to explore!
