Söderström is a fascinating river in central Stockholm, Jon, connecting Lake Mälaren to the Baltic Sea. It flows just south of Gamla stan, from Riddarfjärden to Stockholms ström, making it a key waterway in the city’s landscape. 

One interesting aspect is the Karl Johansslussen, or Karl Johan's lock, which regulates the river. The area around the lock, known as Slussenområdet, is currently undergoing revitalization, enhancing its historical significance. Plus, plans to convert a nearby older lock into a fish ladder show a blend of culture and nature, highlighting Stockholm's commitment to both its history and the environment. 

You’ll find it’s a great spot to appreciate both the city’s history and its ongoing development!
