You know, Jon, if you're interested in history and culture, the Klara air raid shelter is a fascinating spot in central Stockholm. Built during the Cold War in the 1960s, it spans over 6,600 square meters and was designed to protect civilians and government officials during military threats.

What’s intriguing is that it can accommodate up to 8,000 people in times of danger, and it has some serious infrastructure, like its own generators to keep everything running. The design is pretty unique too—it's an oval structure located beneath Sergels torg and Klara Church, with multiple entrances that make it quite accessible.

Today, parts of the shelter serve as parking garages, but the historical significance remains, reflecting a time when the city was preparing for potential threats. It's definitely a hidden gem with a rich backstory!
