You’ll love exploring Karl Johans Torg, Jon! This vibrant public square sits between the historic old town, Gamla Stan, and Slussen in central Stockholm. It’s a hub of activity, especially in the summer when pleasure boats glide through the nearby canal, attracting both locals and tourists. 

At the center of the square, you’ll find the impressive equestrian statue of King Charles XIV John. Interestingly, this statue has undergone a few changes in orientation since it was inaugurated back in 1854. Originally facing east, it was turned to look north and then later adjusted to point south towards a busy roundabout. It symbolizes the fascinating history of the Bernadotte Dynasty, which is still relevant today as Sweden remains a monarchy.

And if you’re into music, don’t miss the nearby rock club, Debaser, which adds a youthful vibe to the area. With its rich history and cultural significance, Karl Johans Torg is definitely worth a visit!
