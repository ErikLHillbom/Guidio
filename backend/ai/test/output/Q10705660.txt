You know, Trångsund is a charming little street tucked away in Gamla stan, the old town of Stockholm. It’s got this quaint feel, stretching from Stortorget right in front of Storkyrkan to Storkyrkobrinken. The narrowness of the street really gives you a sense of its historical roots. 

Interestingly, the name Trångsund means "Narrow Strait," and it has a rich history dating back to the 15th century. Originally, it referred to a different narrow street, but by the late 16th century, it became associated with this alleyway. In fact, it used to be even narrower before the graveyard that once surrounded Storkyrkan was removed in 1816.

You’ll find some fascinating buildings along Trångsund, like Storkyrkan, which has parts dating back to the 12th century, and several other structures from the 17th century. It's a perfect spot for you to soak up some of Stockholm's history and culture while wandering through this picturesque area!
