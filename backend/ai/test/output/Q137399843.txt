You know, Jon, the Jetline roller coaster at Gröna Lund amusement park had quite a tragic incident on June 25, 2023. It was a popular steel coaster that had been delighting visitors since 1988. Unfortunately, during a ride, a train partially derailed due to a failure in a control arm, which was later found to have been improperly manufactured. This led to one passenger losing their life and nine others sustaining injuries.

The ride was immediately closed, and investigations revealed significant issues in the manufacturing process that contributed to the accident. Ultimately, the roller coaster was permanently closed and later demolished. This incident has sparked discussions around safety standards in amusement parks, especially when it comes to rides from manufacturers that are no longer in operation. It’s a real somber chapter in the park’s history, but it did lead to a greater focus on safety protocols.
