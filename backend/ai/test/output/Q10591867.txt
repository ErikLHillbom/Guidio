You know, Myntgatan is quite a fascinating spot in Gamla stan, the historic heart of Stockholm. It stretches from Mynttorget to Riddarhustorget, and it’s surrounded by some significant buildings, primarily housing the Parliament and the Supreme Court. 

What's interesting, Jon, is that the street has a rich history. It was originally referred to as Skattmestere Gattun back in the 1630s, likely connecting to a treasurer who owned land there. It really came to life in the late 17th century after Stora Nygatan was built, leading to the street we see today in a lovely Baroque style. The transformation from a more medieval layout to this street reflects Stockholm's evolution over time.
