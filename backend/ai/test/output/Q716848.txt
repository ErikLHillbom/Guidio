You’re going to love Nybroplan, Jon! This vibrant public space is nestled right at the junction of the Norrmalm and Östermalm districts in central Stockholm. It perfectly connects major streets like Birger Jarlsgatan and Strandvägen, making it a bustling hub.

What’s fascinating is its rich history. Until the 18th century, this area was actually part of the bay, known as Nybroviken. It transformed over time into the beautiful Berzelii Park you might see nearby. The name Nybroplan comes from an old bridge that once spanned the bay, reminding us of the area’s evolution through the years.

You’ll also find some interesting public art here, including monuments dedicated to notable Swedes like the diplomat Raoul Wallenberg and inventor John Ericsson. Plus, there’s a quirky bronze sculpture called “Humor” that’s sure to catch your eye.

Oh, and if you’re up for a short ferry ride, it’s a fantastic launch point for trips to Djurgården and the stunning Stockholm Archipelago. Can't wait for you to explore this lively spot!
