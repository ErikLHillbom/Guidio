You know, Jon, if you stroll down Torstenssonsgatan in Östermalm, you’ll find a charming, wide avenue lined with linden trees. It’s quite short—only about 200 meters—perfect for a leisurely walk. The street connects Strandvägen and Storgatan but isn’t a through street, so it has that cozy vibe.

What’s really interesting is its namesake, Lennart Torstensson, a notable Swedish Field Marshal from the 17th century, which adds a nice touch of history to the area. Plus, if you continue along the avenue, you’ll come across the Museum of National Antiquities, which is a fantastic spot to dive into Sweden’s rich history and culture. It sounds like a perfect match for your interests!
