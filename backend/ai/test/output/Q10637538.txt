Oh, you’ll find Poppius journalistskola quite fascinating, especially since you're interested in history and culture! This school is actually the oldest journalism school in Scandinavia, founded way back in 1947 right here in Stockholm by Set Poppius, a seasoned journalist. 

What’s interesting is that it was established during a time when there were no formal journalism training programs in the region, and it really broke new ground as the only private journalism school in the Nordic countries at that time. Set and his wife, Ebba, worked together to build a strong reputation for the school, which produced many notable journalists over the years. 

Today, it’s run by a non-profit foundation, funded entirely by student tuition, maintaining its legacy as a vital part of Sweden’s journalistic education. So, if you're exploring the cultural landscape of Stockholm, understanding the roots of journalism here might be quite enriching for you, Jon!
