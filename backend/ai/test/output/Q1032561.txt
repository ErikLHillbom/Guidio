Jon, let me tell you about Skatteskrapan, a fascinating piece of Stockholm's skyline. This 26-storey building, reaching 86 meters tall, is located in the vibrant Södermalm district. Originally completed in 1959, it was the tallest building in Sweden until 1964, showcasing the architectural ambition of the time.

Designed by architect Paul Hedqvist for the Swedish National Tax Board, Skatteskrapan has an intriguing history. It served as tax offices until 2003 when it underwent a major transformation into student apartments under the vision of then Mayor Annika Billström. Now, it houses 415 student apartments along with office space, shops, and restaurants—making it a lively hub of activity.

One of the highlights, Jon, is the new skybar added during the renovation, which offers stunning views of the city. Interestingly, the building is a protected cultural landmark, ensuring that its external appearance remains unchanged, preserving a piece of Stockholm's rich architectural heritage. If you appreciate history and culture, Skatteskrapan is definitely worth a visit!
