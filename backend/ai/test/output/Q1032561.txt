Oh, you’ll love hearing about Skatteskrapan! This iconic skyscraper, known as "The Tax Scraper," stands proudly in Södermalm at Götgatan 76. When it was completed in 1959, it held the title of the tallest building in Sweden for five years. It originally reached 81 meters but now stands at 86 meters with 26 floors.

The building was designed by architect Paul Hedqvist and served the Swedish National Tax Board until 2003. After its renovation, it transformed into a vibrant space featuring 415 student apartments, shops, and even a skybar on top. Isn’t it fascinating how it has evolved while still being recognized as a cultural landmark? The blend of history and modern living really makes it a unique spot in Stockholm.
