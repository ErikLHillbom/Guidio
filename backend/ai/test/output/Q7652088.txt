You’ll love exploring Sven Vintappares Torg, a charming little square tucked away in Gamla stan, the historic heart of Stockholm. This quaint space was actually created in the 18th century as a turning area for horse-drawn vehicles, which is pretty fascinating given the narrow, winding streets of the old town.

It’s surrounded by alleys like Sven Vintappares Gränd and Didrik Ficks Gränd, which lead you deeper into the vibrant streets. Although it didn’t have a name for quite some time, it officially became known as Sven Vintappares Torg in 2002. So, Jon, as you wander through, you can really sense the history that resonates in every corner!
