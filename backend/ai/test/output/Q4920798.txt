You know, Jon, the Black Friars' Monastery, or Svartbrödraklostret, is a fascinating piece of Stockholm's history. Founded back in 1336 by King Magnus IV, it was the home of the Dominican order on Stadsholmen. It’s intriguing how the monastery became a significant political center, especially during those chaotic times in the 15th century. 

Even though it was demolished in 1547 on Gustav Vasa’s orders, you can still explore some preserved vaults today. These remnants really give a sense of the medieval atmosphere that once thrived here. Svartmangatan, leading down to where the monastery stood, still whispers tales from that era. If you're keen on history and culture, this spot is definitely worth checking out when you’re exploring!
