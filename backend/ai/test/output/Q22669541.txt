Have you heard about the Sofia metro station, Jon? It’s a fascinating upcoming addition to the Stockholm metro, part of the Blue Line extension that links Kungsträdgården with Nacka and Hagsätra. What’s really impressive is that it will be one of the deepest metro stations in the world, sitting about 100 meters underground!

The station will feature a unique design with a single underground island platform, and instead of the usual escalators, it will have high-speed lifts that zip you up and down in just 30 seconds. This setup is due to its incredible depth, making it quite a marvel in terms of engineering and design. 

Located in Stigbergsparken on Folkungagatan in Södermalm, the station is expected to enhance accessibility to this vibrant, culturally rich area. Construction is underway, and while it won’t be open until 2030, it’s certainly an exciting project to keep an eye on!
