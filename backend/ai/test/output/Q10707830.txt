You know, Jon, Tyska Stallplan is quite a fascinating spot in Gamla stan, right in the heart of Stockholm. It stretches from Svartmangatan to Prästgatan and connects with a few other charming streets, creating a lovely little maze to explore.

Historically, this area has some intriguing roots. It was home to the Blackfriars monastery back in the 1330s until the Reformation. If you look closely, you might spot remnants of the monastery walls beneath the streets. By the way, it used to have several stables in the 18th and 19th centuries, giving it the "Stable Plane" name. 

There's even a granite sculpture from 1956 that depicts a young man mounting a horse, which has quite the story of its own, having been damaged and restored a few times over the years. It’s a lovely blend of history and art that’s worth a stroll through, especially for someone like you who's into culture!
