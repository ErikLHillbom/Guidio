You know, Jon, if you’re in Stockholm during the second half of November, the Stockholm International Film Festival is a fantastic event to check out. It kicked off back in 1990 and has since become a key platform for emerging filmmakers. What’s really cool is that it not only showcases new talent but also celebrates cinematic achievements with awards like the prestigious Bronze Horse, which is actually the heaviest film award in the world!

This festival is known for its unique atmosphere—imagine watching films under the winter sky while mingling with filmmakers and actors. It also hosts seminars and workshops that could deepen your appreciation for cinema. Plus, it’s been a site of memorable moments, like when David Lynch received a Lifetime Achievement Award there. 

If you love films and want to experience a bit of Swedish culture, this festival is definitely worth your time!
