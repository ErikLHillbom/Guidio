Oh, you're in for a treat with St. Eric's Cathedral! This stunning Catholic cathedral is located in Södermalm, right in the heart of Stockholm. Built in 1892, it wasn't officially designated a cathedral until 1953, when the Catholic Diocese of Stockholm was established. 

What's particularly interesting, Jon, is how the cathedral reflects the growth of the Catholic community in Sweden, especially after World War II. An extension was added in 1983, designed by architects Hans Westman and Ylva Lenormand, to accommodate the increasing number of worshippers. 

The cathedral is named after Saint Eric, Sweden's patron saint, who has a fascinating history as a martyr. If you’re into history and culture, this place really encapsulates a significant part of Stockholm's religious and social evolution. Plus, the architecture itself is quite striking!
