Have you heard about Brända Tomten? It’s a charming little square tucked away in Gamla stan, the historic heart of Stockholm. Jon, this triangular public space has a fascinating history, named “The Burnt Lot” after a building that was destroyed by fire back in 1728. 

Today, it offers a cozy atmosphere with benches under a chestnut tree, surrounded by ivy-covered façades. In the summer, you might even catch local storytellers sharing tales, adding to the cultural vibe of the area. 

If you take a closer look, you’ll find remnants of medieval history hidden behind the square’s buildings, some of which date back to the 16th century. It’s quite remarkable to think about the stories that have unfolded here over the centuries. Plus, the famous Swedish author August Strindberg was inspired by this very spot when he wrote a play named after it. 

So, if you're wandering around, Brända Tomten is definitely worth a visit for a taste of the city's rich history and culture.
