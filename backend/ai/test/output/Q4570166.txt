You know, Malmskillnadsgatan is quite an interesting street in central Stockholm, stretching about 650 meters. It starts at Brunkebergstorg square and makes its way north, crossing several other streets along the way. 

What’s really cool, Jon, is that the name itself means "The Ridge Dividing Street." This area was shaped by the last ice age, leaving behind those unique ridges filled with sand and gravel. Malmskillnadsgatan runs along one of those ridges, which historically divided the Norrmalm district into Östermalm and Västermalm.

The street has been around since at least the 17th century, and it’s fascinating how it evolved from a simple road to what it is today. In the late 20th century, it even had a reputation for being a hub for street activities, reflecting its changing role over time. It’s definitely a spot where you can feel the layers of history!
