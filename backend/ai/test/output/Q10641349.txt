You’re in for a treat exploring Prästgatan, Jon! This charming street in Gamla Stan, or the old town of Stockholm, has a rich history. It runs from a cul-de-sac by the Royal Palace to Österlånggatan, and it’s flanked by several other quaint streets.

Prästgatan got its name back in the 16th century when a few chaplains and a bell-ringer lived there. It used to be known as Tyska Prästgatan and Svenska Prästgatan, reflecting the German and Swedish parish connections in the area. Pretty cool how names evolve over time, right?

One of the highlights along the street is a fascinating runestone at the corner of Prästgatan and Kåkbrinken. This ancient stone, believed to be about 1,000 years old, holds an inscription about a family. It’s a rare piece of history, giving you a glimpse into the past long before Stockholm was even founded.

As you stroll through, keep an eye out for the charming alleys that branch off, each with its own story. There’s a rich tapestry of culture and history here that makes Prästgatan a must-see on your visit!
