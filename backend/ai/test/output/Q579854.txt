Gamla Stan is such a fascinating spot, especially for someone like you who’s into history and culture, Jon. This charming old town of Stockholm dates back to the 13th century and is packed with medieval alleyways and cobbled streets that really take you back in time.

At the heart of Gamla Stan is Stortorget, the main square, where you can feel the history—it’s even the site of the infamous Stockholm Bloodbath in 1520. You’ll also find stunning architecture influenced by North German styles, with notable landmarks like the Royal Palace and the Stockholm Cathedral, or Storkyrkan, which is home to the impressive statue of St. George and the Dragon.

The area’s transformation is also interesting; it went from a slum in the mid-19th century to a vibrant tourist destination today. So, wandering through these streets, you’ll truly be walking through centuries of Swedish history. I think you’d really enjoy the atmosphere and the stories each corner holds!
