Oh, Jon, you’ll find the Foundation for the Furthering of Music Culture, also known as the Nydahl Collection, quite fascinating! Established in 1920 by Captain Rudolf Nydahl, this spot in Stockholm is dedicated to preserving an impressive array of musical instruments, manuscripts, and other music-related artifacts. Nydahl, who once studied at the Conservatoire de Paris, began this venture after his family wine shop was expropriated.

The museum opened in 1967, and now it's situated at Riddargatan 37. You can explore a collection of around 550 historic instruments, including beautiful harpsichords and pianos dating back to the 16th century. There are also original compositions from renowned composers like Mozart and Beethoven, along with a treasure trove of letters and documents that music lovers will appreciate. If you're into history and culture, this place is definitely worth a visit!
