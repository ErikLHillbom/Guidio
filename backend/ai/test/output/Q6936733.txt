Munkbron is a fascinating spot, especially if you're into history and culture, Jon. Situated on the western waterfront of Gamla stan, the old town of Stockholm, it’s divided into two parts by the Aurora block, which houses the Petersen House. 

The area has a rich history—originally, Munkbron referred to a bridge that connected to Riddarholmen, where the Greyfriars abbey once stood. Over the centuries, its name has shifted and evolved, reflecting the changes in the surrounding landscape and community. Today, it’s a lively square accessibly linked to several charming streets like Stora Gråmunkegränd and Lilla Nygatan.

You might enjoy exploring this square, as it captures the essence of Stockholm's past while offering lovely views of the canal!
