You’ll love exploring Klockgjutargränd, Jon! This charming little alley in Gamla stan has a fascinating history. It connects Västerlånggatan to Brantingtorget, tucked away under a low vault that gives it a unique character. 

The name, which means "Bell-Founder's Alley," honors a German craftsman named Jurgen Putens, who settled here in the early 1620s. He was quite the innovator, founding the bells for Stockholm Cathedral and even introducing fire extinguishers after a devastating fire in 1625. 

So, as you wander through this quaint passage, you’re stepping into a piece of the city's rich history—definitely a must-see for someone like you, who appreciates culture!
