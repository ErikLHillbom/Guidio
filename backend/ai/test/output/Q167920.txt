You know, Jon, the Royal Swedish Academy of Fine Arts is a fascinating place right in the heart of Stockholm. Established way back in 1735, it began as a drawing school, modeled after French academies, and has evolved beautifully over the years. 

The academy really took off in the late 18th century, becoming a hub for prominent artists like Johan Tobias Sergel. It shifted names a couple of times and finally became the Royal Swedish Academy of Fine Arts in 1810, which it still goes by today. What's interesting is that while it originally had a strong focus on traditional art, by the 1830s, there was a push for more contemporary styles and inclusion, with women being allowed to study art much later in 1864.

If you’re into history and culture, the academy’s rich past and its stunning 17th-century building, redesigned in the 1800s, make it a meaningful stop to explore.
