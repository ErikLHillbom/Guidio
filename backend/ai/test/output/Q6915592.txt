You’ll love Mosebacke, Jon! This charming square and park in Södermalm has a rich history that dates back to the 1850s. After a devastating fire in 1857, the area was transformed, and the park was finally completed in the early 1940s.

What’s fascinating is that Mosebacke has been a cultural hotspot since the 18th century. It’s home to Stockholm's oldest private theatre, Södra teatern, which has hosted performances from local legends like Cornelis Vreeswijk. You’ll also find inviting restaurants and an outdoor terrace—perfect for soaking up the vibrant atmosphere while enjoying the scenery.
