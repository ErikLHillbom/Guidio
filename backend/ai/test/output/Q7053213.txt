You know, if you're wandering around Gamla stan, you should definitely check out Norra Bankogränd. It’s this charming alley that connects Skeppsbron to Österlånggatan and Järntorget, making it a lovely little pathway to explore. 

This alley has a rich history, as it runs right by the former Bank of Sweden building, designed by the renowned architect Nicodemus Tessin the Elder back in the late 1600s. It's fascinating to think about all the changes that have occurred since it was first recorded on maps in the 18th century. Plus, there's a covered bridge that adds a unique touch—built during the 1770s when the northern bank building was established.

So if you're interested in history and culture, Norra Bankogränd is a perfect spot to dive into the old-world charm of Stockholm, Jon!
