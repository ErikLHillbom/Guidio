Have you heard about Lejonbacken, Jon? It’s quite a fascinating spot right by the Royal Palace in Stockholm. Built in the 1780s, this system of ramps is not just a way to enter the palace; it’s adorned with sculpted Medici lions that give it a regal character.

From the top of the ramps, you get a stunning panoramic view of the surrounding area, including the impressive Norrbro bridge and the Royal Opera. The history behind the ramps is intriguing too, as they were a part of the plans for rebuilding the old medieval palace after a fire destroyed it in 1697. 

If you're into museums, you'll also find the Gustav III's Museum of Antiquities nearby. It showcases over 200 sculptures collected by the king during his travels. Plus, underneath the ramps, there's the Tre Kronor Museum, which dives into the castle’s medieval history.

Lejonbacken beautifully combines art, history, and architecture, making it a must-see for someone interested in the rich culture of Stockholm!
