You know, Jon, Maria-Gamla Stan was a fascinating area in central Stockholm until it merged in 2007 to become part of the larger Södermalm borough. It was named after the Maria Magdalena parish and the iconic Old Town, known locally as Gamla Stan. 

This borough had an interesting history; it was established as an administrative division in 1996 and expanded in 1999 by merging with Hornstull. At its peak, it covered several islands and had a vibrant population of over 64,000. If you’re keen on exploring the cultural fabric of Stockholm, this area certainly played a unique role in shaping the city’s development.
