You’ll definitely want to check out Gustav Adolfs torg while you’re in Stockholm, Jon. This public square is located right in the heart of Norrmalm and is named after King Gustav II Adolf. It's not just a lovely spot to relax, but you can also admire a striking statue of the king himself, crafted by Pierre Hubert L'Archevêque back in 1796.

Surrounding the square are impressive buildings like the Royal Opera and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, making it a cultural hub. Plus, just a stone's throw away are the Riksdag Building and the Royal Palace, so it’s a great starting point to dive into the history and architecture of the city. It’s a perfect blend of culture and history that I think you’ll really enjoy!
