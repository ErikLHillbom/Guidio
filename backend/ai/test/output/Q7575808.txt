Just a stone's throw from Storkyrkan church, you'll find Spektens Gränd, a charming alley in Gamla stan. It’s fascinating how this little passageway connects Trångsund and Prästgatan, running parallel to other quaint streets like Storkyrkobrinken. 

Jon, did you know it was created back in 1675? The name comes from a merchant named Gert Specht, who owned one of the houses here in the late 1600s. As you stroll through, keep an eye out for the two small courtyards. One features some intriguing cast iron decorations, including a lion head and a gate with the star of David, while the other has a unique portal with an inscription dating back to 1667. It’s a lovely spot that captures a piece of Stockholm's rich history!
