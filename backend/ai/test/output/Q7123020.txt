You’ll find Packhusgränd tucked away in Gamla stan, which is the charming old town of Stockholm. This alley, whose name translates to "Warehouse Alley," stretches from Skeppsbron to Österlånggatan, perfectly paralleling Johannesgränd and Tullgränd.

It's fascinating to think that the area has been significant since the 13th century, serving as a berth when the waterfront was much further east. The name Packhusgränd first appeared in 1733, but before that, it was known as Urbansgränden after a local estate owner. The alley's history is rich with connections to the customs department and even medieval harbors. 

If you're strolling around, you might even spot the customs house from the 1780s, which replaced the earlier warehouse that inspired the alley's name. It’s a spot where history and culture intertwine beautifully, don’t you think?
