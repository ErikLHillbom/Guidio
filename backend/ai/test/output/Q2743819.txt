You’ll want to check out ABBA The Museum while you’re in Stockholm, Jon. Opened in May 2013, this interactive exhibition is situated on Djurgården Island, close to the Gröna Lund theme park. It’s a fantastic spot that celebrates the iconic Swedish pop group ABBA, showcasing their collected works in a modern setting.

The museum features some really cool exhibits, like Benny’s self-playing piano, which is connected to his own piano at home. You can also step into a recreated version of the Polar Studio, where ABBA recorded many of their hits. There’s even a section that looks just like Brighton from the 1974 Eurovision Song Contest, complete with memorabilia from that time.

One of the highlights is an audio guide narrated by Catherine Johnson, the genius behind *Mamma Mia!*, which really brings the experience to life. It’s definitely a must-see for anyone interested in music history and culture!
