You’ll love Bredgränd, Jon! This charming alley in Gamla stan has quite the history. Stretching from Skeppsbron to Österlånggatan, it’s known as the "Wide Alley," and was historically referred to as Tunnbindargränden, or "The Barrel Binding Alley." 

What’s really interesting is that it’s wider than many of the neighboring alleys, which is how it earned its name. Plus, archaeological digs here uncovered parts of the old city wall from the late Middle Ages, showcasing the rich history that surrounds you in this area. It’s a perfect spot to wander and soak in the culture of Stockholm!
