You know, Jon, Norrström is quite a fascinating little river right in central Stockholm. It's among the shortest rivers in all of Europe and serves as a natural connection between Lake Mälaren and the Baltic Sea. The river runs from Riddarfjärden, just north of Gamla stan, to Stockholms ström, making its way through the heart of the city.

One of the interesting aspects is that it features two islands within it—Strömsborg and Helgeandsholmen—adding a unique charm to the waterway. While it's not navigable by larger boats, the current typically flows from west to east, which is interesting considering the higher water levels in Mälaren. Plus, it attracts sport fishers with various fish species like sea trout and salmon. 

If you enjoy immersing yourself in the city's history and culture, Norrström is worth a visit. You can stroll across the impressive bridges like Centralbron and Vasabron, taking in the views of this significant waterway. What do you think, Jon? Sounds like a nice spot to explore, right?
