You know, Jon, one of the most significant events in Stockholm's history is the Great Stockholm Fire of 1759. It broke out on July 19 in the Eastern Södermalm, devastating around 20 blocks and burning about 300 houses to the ground, which left around 2000 people homeless. Fortunately, there were no reported deaths, although 19 people were injured.

The fire, often referred to as Mariabranden in Sweden, got its name from the Maria Magdalena Church, which was heavily damaged during the blaze. What’s fascinating is that an anecdote exists about Emanuel Swedenborg, the scientist and mystic, who supposedly “saw” the fire from Gothenburg, claiming it stopped just three buildings from his home in Stockholm!

After the fire, there were significant changes in building regulations, leading to a more fire-resistant city. It's intriguing how events like this shape the culture and architecture, don’t you think?
