You’ll definitely want to check out Salviigränd when you’re in Gamla stan, Jon. It’s the northernmost alley in this charming old town of Stockholm, stretching from Västerlånggatan to Myntgatan. The alley is named after Johan Adler Salvius, a fascinating diplomat from the 17th century who made a name for himself by marrying a wealthy widow. 

Strolling through, you’ll notice the historic vibe and feel the rich history surrounding you. There’s even a beautifully restored suite created by Louis Masreliez on the second floor of one of the buildings, showcasing elegant Gustavian Classicism with pastel and gold tones. It’s a perfect little spot to soak in some culture and history while exploring!
