If you’re interested in military history, the Swedish Army Museum should definitely be on your list while you’re in Stockholm. Nestled in the Östermalm district, this museum reopened in 2002 and was even named the best museum in Stockholm a few years later! 

Originally established in 1879, the site has a rich history of military use dating back to the 17th century. The exhibitions are quite engaging—showcasing not just weaponry and uniforms, but also the living conditions of soldiers and their families throughout various periods of conflict and peace. There’s even a special room dedicated to the trophies and flags from battles in the 17th and 18th centuries.

Plus, if you have any interest in humanitarian history, there’s a mini-exhibition about Raoul Wallenberg, the Swedish diplomat known for his heroic efforts during World War II. It’s a captivating place that intertwines Sweden’s military past with broader cultural narratives. I think you’d find it fascinating, Jon!
