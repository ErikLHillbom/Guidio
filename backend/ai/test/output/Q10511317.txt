You’re going to love the Golden Hall, Jon! It’s a stunning banqueting space inside Stockholm City Hall, stretching an impressive 44 meters long. You’ll find it decorated with incredible mosaics by Einar Forseth, designed on the architect Ragnar Östberg's proposal. 

What’s really cool is that this hall is the venue for the ball following the annual Nobel Banquet, making it a key part of Sweden's cultural celebrations. The mosaics themselves are a feast for the eyes, depicting historical allegories and motifs from around Stockholm, including a seated Queen of Lake Mälar, which beautifully represents the city’s connection to its waterways.

Originally built from stone and granite, it was transformed into the Golden Hall we see today thanks to a generous donation in the early 20th century. The intricate artworks took a few years to install, but the result is absolutely worth it. If you're interested in history and culture, this is definitely a highlight of Stockholm!
