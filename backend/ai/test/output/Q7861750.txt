Tyska Skolgränd is a fascinating little alley in Gamla Stan, Stockholm’s charming old town. Stretching from Svartmangatan to Baggensgatan, it has a rich history that dates back to the late 16th century, when it was home to a German school. The alley’s name, which means "German School Alley," first appeared on a map in the early 18th century.

What’s really interesting, Jon, is that the original school building was constructed in 1626, and the area has seen various changes over the years, including being frequented by theater groups in the 17th century. If you look closely, you can spot a sandstone cartouche over one of the buildings that dates back to the 1670s, featuring a Latin phrase celebrating the school’s legacy.

As you stroll through, you can appreciate how the alley reflects the multicultural tapestry of Stockholm's history. It’s a lovely spot to soak in the vibe of the old town while imagining the stories that have unfolded there!
