You’ll definitely want to check out Dansmuseet while you’re in Stockholm. This unique museum, which opened in 1953, is dedicated to the performing and visual arts, with a strong focus on dance. It’s fascinating to think that it started in the basement of the Royal Swedish Opera! 

Originally, it showcased an impressive collection of dance art from Rolf de Maré, a notable figure in the Ballets suédois during the early 20s. Today, you can find it on Drottninggatan 17, where it houses the most extensive archive on dance literature in Northern Europe. 

If you're into history, Jon, you’d appreciate its collection that spans materials from 1500 to 1850, along with a vast library of journals and videos on dance. There’s even a special focus on Russian dance, which adds a rich layer to its cultural offerings. It’s a must-visit for anyone passionate about the intersection of art and culture!
