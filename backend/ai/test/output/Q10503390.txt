Engelbrektsplan is a charming town square nestled in Östermalm, Stockholm, right next to the lovely Humlegården park. You'd probably find it interesting, Jon, that this square was established back in 1884 when a brewery was demolished. 

The architecture here is quite striking, especially the large corner house built in 1914. It used to serve as a terminal station for the Djursholmsbanan tramway, connecting locals to the Roslagsbanan rail system for decades. It's a great spot to soak in a bit of Stockholm's history and culture!
