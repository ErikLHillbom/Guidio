You know, Jon, the Great Stockholm Fire of 1625 is quite a significant event in the city's history. It started on the evening of September 1st in Kåkbrinken and raged for three days, devastating the southwestern part of Stadsholmen. Can you imagine? About a fifth of Stockholm’s infrastructure was destroyed!

What’s interesting is that this disaster led to major changes in the city. After the fire, they actually rebuilt large parts of the city and implemented a stricter fire prevention inspection system. So, in a way, that fire helped shape modern Stockholm. It’s fascinating how such a catastrophic event could lead to progress, don’t you think?
