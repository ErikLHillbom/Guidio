Sweden had a unique but brief history of overseas colonies from 1638 to 1878, Jon. It all started with New Sweden, planted along the Delaware River, where Swedish settlers created a vibrant community focused on tobacco and fur trade. Although it only lasted until 1655, it laid the groundwork for some fascinating interactions with the local Susquehannock people.

In the Caribbean, Saint Barthélemy stood out as a significant colony from 1784 to 1878. It became a hub for trade, particularly during the Napoleonic Wars, and was known for its remarkable religious tolerance, allowing various denominations to coexist, which was quite progressive for that time. The island even had a thriving trade network until it was ceded back to France.

In West Africa, Sweden had a brief presence on the Gold Coast, establishing forts that were lost back to Denmark. It's interesting how these colonies reflected Sweden's ambitions and the shifting dynamics of colonial powers back then. So if you’re intrigued by the complexities of colonial history, Sweden’s attempts at overseas expansion certainly add a unique chapter to the tale!
