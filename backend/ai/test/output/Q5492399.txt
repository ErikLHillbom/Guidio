Oh, you're in for a treat with Frans Schartaus gymnasium! This school, named after the MP mission Frans Schartau, has quite a rich history. Founded back in 1865, it was originally established to equip young people with essential trade and language skills. The current building, which you’ll find at Bohusgatan, dates from 1945 and was designed by notable architects Nils Ahrbom and Helge Zimdahl. 

What’s intriguing, Jon, is that the school has evolved over the years and now serves around 670 students, focusing on economics, trade, and languages. The auditorium here is particularly famous for its unique design and impressive acoustics, plus there's a striking relief by artist Tyra Lundgren outside. 

It’s also interesting to note that the gymnasium has extensive partnerships with local industries and international schools, enhancing its educational offerings. If you appreciate places with a strong cultural and historical background, this is definitely one to explore!
