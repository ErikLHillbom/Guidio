Have you heard of TioTretton? It’s part of the renowned Kulturhuset, a cultural center that really embodies modernism in Stockholm. Just south of Sergels torg, this place has quite the history! It was designed by architect Peter Celsing and opened its doors back in 1971. 

Kulturhuset is more than just an architectural gem; it has served as a vibrant hub for cultural events, from exhibitions to concerts, making it a favorite for both locals and visitors alike. TioTretton, specifically, is a unique space crafted for children, allowing them to explore and play in their own way while keeping a boundary for adults. It’s a wonderful example of how culture and community come together in Stockholm, wouldn’t you agree, Jon?
