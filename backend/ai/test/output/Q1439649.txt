If you're up for some fascinating history and culture, Fotografiska in Stockholm is a must-visit. Founded in 2010, this unique museum network focuses on photography and art, with exhibitions that feature both established and emerging photographers. What’s great for you, Jon, is that they have a rotating program, so each visit can offer something new and exciting.

The building itself is a former customs house from 1906, which adds a bit of historical charm to your experience. You can enjoy not just the artwork but also some excellent cuisine and even shop at their retail spaces. Plus, extended hours mean you can pop in after a long day of exploring the city. 

With events like talks and panel discussions, Fotografiska really immerses visitors in the cultural scene. This place just vibrates with creativity and offers a fresh perspective on visual storytelling. Sounds like a perfect fit for your interests, doesn’t it?
