You’ll find Uppland Runic Inscription 53 tucked away in Gamla stan, right at the intersection of Prästgatan and Kåkbrinken. It’s not the biggest or the most beautiful runestone, but it has quite the historical significance, especially for someone like you who's interested in history and culture, Jon.

This stone dates back to the 11th century and was likely brought from nearby Iron Age settlements. It features an interesting inscription, commemorating a figure named Torsten and his wife Frögunn, who erected the stone in memory of their son—though his name remains a mystery. The dragon design is typical of the Urnes style, known for its sleek, interwoven animal motifs. 

Even more fascinating is the fact that this stone has been carved by at least two different artisans, which was discovered through a detailed laser analysis. So, while it might look a bit worn down, it’s a significant piece of local history that connects you with the past right here in the heart of Stockholm!
