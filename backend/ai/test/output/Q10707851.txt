You know, Tysta Mari is quite an interesting spot in Stockholm’s history, Jon. Established back in 1834 by Maria Christina Lindström, this coffee shop became a hub for artists, intellectuals, and journalists. The name “Tysta Mari,” which means "Silent Mary," reflects Lindström's discreet style of service.

Originally located at the intersection of Jakobsgatan and Drottninggatan, Tysta Mari became well-known for its atmosphere, especially among upper-class women, since it was a place where no alcohol was served. Unfortunately, the original café closed in 1954 when the building was demolished, but don't worry! A new Tysta Mari opened in 1974 in Östermalm, carrying on the legacy.

Fun fact: there’s even a walkway named Tysta Marigången that connects to the café's old location! If you're into cultural history, this place certainly has a lot to offer.
