Brantingtorget is a charming courtyard located in the heart of Gamla stan, Stockholm's old town. Named after Sweden's first democratically elected Prime Minister, Hjalmar Branting, it's a blend of history and modern architecture. Designed by Artur von Schmalensee, the square was constructed between 1945 and 1950.

What’s fascinating, Jon, is how this space cleverly combines the old with the new. You’ll find remnants of narrow alleys like Klockgjutargränd and Kolmätargränd that once weaved through the area, contrasting beautifully with the larger open square. There's even a striking bronze sculpture called "Morgon" from 1962, adding an artistic touch to the atmosphere. It’s a perfect spot to appreciate the rich history and culture of Stockholm.
