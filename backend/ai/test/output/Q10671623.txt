If you’re keen on history and culture, Slottsarkivet is a fascinating spot to check out while you're in Stockholm. Established in 1893, this palace archive holds important documents from the Royal Court and various royal palaces. Since 1964, it has been part of the National Archives of Sweden, which really emphasizes its significance. 

You’ll find the archives of kings and queens before 1800 at another location, but Slottsarkivet itself includes a reference library, which might be of interest to you, Jon. It’s a great place to dive into the rich history of the Swedish monarchy. Plus, being right at Stockholm Palace, it’s pretty easy to fit into your exploration of the area!
