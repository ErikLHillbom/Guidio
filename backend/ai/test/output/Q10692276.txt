You know, Jon, the Old Stockholm telephone tower is quite a fascinating piece of history here in the city. Built in 1887, it was designed to connect about 5,500 telephone lines, which was pretty cutting-edge for its time. The structure stood at 80 meters tall and featured some lovely decorative turrets added later on.

Interestingly, it became obsolete by 1913 when underground telephone cabling took over, but for a while, it even served as an advertising space for a local company. Unfortunately, a significant fire in 1952 weakened it, leading to its demolition the following year. It's a reminder of how quickly technology evolves, don’t you think?
