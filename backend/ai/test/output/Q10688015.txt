Have you heard of Sällskapet, Jon? It’s an exclusive gentlemen's club right here in Stockholm, established back in 1800 by a group of socialites inspired by London’s private clubs. It has a rich history tied to the elite and has been a gathering spot for prominent figures, including the king himself.

The clubhouse, designed by architect Johan Fredrik Åbom, is quite intriguing. Located at 7 Arsenalsgatan, it features lounges, a billiards room, and even a library with over 15,000 books! One unique aspect is that the dining room includes an exact replica of a famous banqueting hall from a hotel that no longer exists, making it the only place to enjoy the classic Swedish dish, Biff Rydberg, in its original setting.

Membership is quite limited, with only 2,000 members allowed, so it really is a special place. If you’re interested in history and culture, Sällskapet definitely embodies the exclusive social fabric of Stockholm.
