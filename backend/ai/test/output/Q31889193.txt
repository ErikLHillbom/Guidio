You know, Jon, if you're interested in history and culture, the Unstraight Museum is a fascinating spot in Stockholm. It's not just your typical museum; it's an online platform and community initiative that highlights LGBTQ+ lives and stories through digital collections, community projects, and traveling exhibitions.

The museum traces its roots back to EuroPride 2008, where it started exploring LGBTQ+ and human rights perspectives in museum collections. It aims to fill gaps in the representation of queer histories, which makes it quite unique. The term "unstraight" is used to indicate a broad, inclusive approach to sexuality and gender, rather than sticking to fixed identities.

What’s particularly cool is how it brings together user-contributed stories and artifacts, making it a true community-driven project. They’ve even collaborated with international partners on exhibitions like "Unstraight Perspectives" in Hanoi, showcasing local LGBT groups in both Hanoi and Göteborg.

With its innovative approach to storytelling and curation, the Unstraight Museum stands out as a beacon for alternative heritage institutions. If you're up for exploring more about queer history, this could be a great addition to your itinerary!
