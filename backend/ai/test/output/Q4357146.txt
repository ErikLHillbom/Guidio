You’ll definitely want to check out Medborgarhuset while you’re exploring Södermalm, Jon. This civic hall, built between 1936 and 1939, showcases an intriguing blend of Neoclassical and Functionalist architecture designed by Karl Martin Westerberg. 

What’s really cool is that it houses a variety of community facilities, including a public bath, an auditorium, and a local library. The building was thoughtfully restored in the '80s, adding some modern touches like a winter garden to the bath area. 

It's also known for its historical significance; in fact, Anna Lindh, the Swedish minister for foreign affairs, gave her last speech right on its steps before her tragic assassination in 2003. So, there’s a lot of cultural weight wrapped up in this building, making it a fascinating stop during your visit!
