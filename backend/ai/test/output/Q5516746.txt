You know, Gaffelgränd is quite the charming little alley in Gamla stan, Stockholm's old town. It connects Skeppsbron to Lilla Hoparegränd and Pelikansgränd, and you'll find it runs parallel to other quaint streets. It dates back to the 1630s, emerging as the old city wall came down and Skeppsbron was built. 

The name itself has an interesting history. Originally called "Gavel Alley" in the 1720s, it might refer to the gable visible from Skeppsbron, or it could be about the fork-like shape created by the three alleys. 

What’s even cooler, Jon, is that this alley has inspired some notable cultural references. The famous troubadour Carl Michael Bellman mentioned it in his work, celebrating the local taverns. It’s a great spot to soak up some history while enjoying the ambiance of Stockholm!
