Strandvägen is quite a gem in Östermalm, Jon, known for its rich history and stunning waterfront views. This street was completed just in time for the Stockholm World's Fair in 1897, which really helped put it on the map as one of the city's most prestigious addresses. 

As you stroll down the 1 km stretch from Nybroplan, you'll notice it's lined with beautiful buildings, many designed by top architects of the time, showcasing a mix of architectural styles. One standout is the Bünsow House, which set a high standard for the area and is often referred to as a "brilliant knight's poem in stone." 

The area has been undergoing improvements to enhance its appeal for both pedestrians and ships, making it a perfect spot to soak in the culture and history of Stockholm. It's definitely worth a visit if you're keen on exploring the city's heritage!
