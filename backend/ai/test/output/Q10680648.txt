You know, Jon, the City of Stockholm has a fascinating history. It was a city municipality from 1863 until 1970 and operated under the Office of the Governor of Stockholm for most of that time. The name "Stockholm" dates back to at least 1252, and it became an official city in 1436!

The city grew significantly over the years, incorporating various areas like Royal Djurgården and later Brännkyrka and Bromma. It was all part of a series of municipal reforms that shaped Stockholm into the vibrant place it is today.

It’s interesting to note that the City of Stockholm was merged into Stockholm Municipality in 1971, but its legacy continues to influence the region’s culture and identity. Just imagine how the city has evolved since those early days!
