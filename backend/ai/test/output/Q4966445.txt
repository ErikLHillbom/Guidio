You know, Jon, one interesting spot to check out in central Stockholm is the Regeringsgatans bro, or the Bridge of Regeringsgatan. It’s quite an architectural piece that was inaugurated back in 1910. 

This bridge is fascinating because it’s a combination of an arch and beam design, featuring three reinforced concrete beams that give it a unique look. The vertical sides are dressed in granite, which adds a touch of elegance to its 11.1-meter width. 

What’s really cool is how it uses three arches to cross over Kungsgatan. The central span stretches 14.5 meters above the road, while the side spans clear the sidewalks below. While it may not be the most practical design, it certainly has its charm and is a great example of early 20th-century engineering here in Stockholm.
