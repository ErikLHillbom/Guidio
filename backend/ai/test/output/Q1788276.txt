Sveavägen is such an interesting spot in Stockholm, Jon! This major street starts at Sergels torg in Norrmalm and runs north through the vibrant Vasastan district. It’s popular for being one of the busiest roads in Sweden, which adds to its lively atmosphere.

Historically, it’s quite significant too. For instance, it was the site of the assassination of Prime Minister Olof Palme in 1986, which is a major event in Sweden’s modern history. You’ll also find some notable buildings along the way, like the Stockholm Concert Hall, known for its orchestral music, and the Stockholm School of Economics, which has a beautiful design dating back to the 1920s.

If you're into history and culture, walking along Sveavägen will give you a real sense of the city's past while enjoying the bustling vibe of present-day Stockholm.
