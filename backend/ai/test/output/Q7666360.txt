You’ll love exploring Södra Bankogränd, Jon! This charming alley in Gamla stan connects Skeppsbron to Österlånggatan and Järntorget, giving you a taste of Stockholm’s historic streets. It was known as Banco-gränden back in the 18th century, and the cobblestones you see today were renovated not too long ago, in 2001. 

One interesting tidbit is that it passes right by the former Bank of Sweden, originally designed by the architect Nicodemus Tessin the Elder in the late 17th century. This area really captures the essence of Stockholm's rich history and culture, so take your time to soak it all in while you're there!
