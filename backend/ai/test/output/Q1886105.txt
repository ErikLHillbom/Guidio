You’re in for a treat with the Sager House, Jon! This stunning building, also known as Sager Palace, serves as the official residence of the Prime Minister of Sweden. Nestled right in the heart of Stockholm on Strömgatan, it’s surrounded by significant landmarks like the Ministry for Foreign Affairs and Rosenbad, the Government Chancellery.

The history of the Sager House dates back to the 1640s, but it was transformed into its current form in the 1890s by Robert Sager, featuring beautiful French Baroque Revival architecture. It became the prime minister's residence in 1988 after being renovated for its new purpose. It’s fascinating to think this was the first official residence for Sweden's head of government!

And with its proximity to the Parliament House and the Royal Palace, it’s a perfect spot to soak up some of Stockholm’s rich political history.
