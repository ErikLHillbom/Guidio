Ah, the Brunkeberg Tunnel is quite an interesting spot in Stockholm, Jon! Spanning 231 meters, it connects David Bagares Street and Tunnelgatan, making it a handy route for pedestrians and cyclists. Inaugurated by King Oscar II in 1886, this tunnel runs through the esker known as Brunkebergsåsen. 

What's particularly fascinating is that even after it opened, many locals preferred to stick to the above-ground route since it cost two öre to use the tunnel. It’s a great blend of history and culture, showcasing Stockholm’s evolution. If you enjoy exploring unique historical sites, this tunnel is definitely worth a visit!
