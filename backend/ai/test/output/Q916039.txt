You know, Jon, if you find yourself wandering around Stockholm, Helgeandsholmen is a gem you won't want to miss. This small island is brimming with history and culture, nestled right in the heart of the city. 

It's home to the Riksdag Building, which is the parliament of Sweden—pretty significant, right? The building’s architecture is quite stunning and offers a peek into the country's political life. Plus, there's the Museum of Medieval Stockholm, where you can dive deep into the city's past. 

Helgeandsholmen is also connected to neighboring islands by three bridges, making it easy to explore. And if you fancy a little relaxation, the Strömparterren park on the eastern end has a lovely restaurant and beautiful views of the water. It’s fascinating to think that this island was once a set of islets before they were joined together, shaping the island we see today. Just imagine strolling through its historic streets, Jon, soaking up the essence of old Stockholm.
