You’ll love the Museum of Medieval Stockholm, especially since you're interested in history and culture, Jon. Located just north of the Royal Palace, this museum was built around fascinating archaeological finds from an extensive dig back in the late 1970s, which even uncovered parts of the city wall from the early 16th century. 

Inaugurated in 1986, the museum offers a vivid glimpse into medieval Stockholm, showcasing everything from brick houses and workshops to a harbor and even a gallows. They’ve created immersive exhibitions that tell stories from the city’s medieval history, dating back to the 1250s. 

Plus, in 2010, they had a special exhibition celebrating Birger Jarl, the founder of Stockholm, with a reconstruction of his face, which is pretty cool! Keep in mind, though, that the museum is currently relocating and won’t be open at its original spot until it moves to Börshuset in the Old Town. It’ll be exciting to see what they come up with in their new space!
