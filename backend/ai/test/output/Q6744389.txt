You know, Jon, if you’re in central Stockholm, you should definitely check out Malmskillnadsbron. It’s this stunning arch bridge that connects Malmskillnadsgatan over Kungsgatan. What’s fascinating is that it was built back in 1911, right when they were excavating Brunkebergsåsen for the Kungsgatan area. 

One of the unique features is its two Art Deco towers called Kungstornen flanking the bridge, which really adds to its charm. Plus, it’s not just a typical bridge; it’s dressed in granite slabs and has this interesting three-hinged arch design. If you appreciate history and culture, this spot is a perfect blend of architectural beauty and historical significance!
