You know, Jon, the Siege of Tre Kronor is a fascinating piece of history right here in Stockholm. It took place from October 17, 1501, to May 9, 1502, and was a significant conflict between the Kalmar Union and a rebellion led by Sten Sture the Elder.

During the siege, the castle was surrounded by Swedish rebels, and the situation for the defenders became dire due to food shortages. Queen Christina of Saxony, who was in charge of the castle, had about 1,000 men, mostly mercenaries, at her disposal. The rebels, on the other hand, numbered around 4,000.

After several months of struggle, the queen finally agreed to surrender on May 5, 1502. When they left the castle just a few days later, only 70 of her original force had survived the ordeal. It’s incredible to think about what went on in that castle during such a tumultuous time, isn’t it?
