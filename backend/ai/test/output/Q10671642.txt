The Royal Chapel, or Slottskyrkan, is a fascinating piece of history nestled within Stockholm Palace. Opened in 1754, it serves as the church for the Royal Court, catering to the Swedish royal family and their staff. 

What’s particularly interesting, Jon, is that it’s not just a place for everyday worship but the venue for significant royal events, like weddings and baptisms. For instance, Princess Madeleine and Prince Carl Philip both exchanged vows here. The chapel also holds royal baptisms, such as that of Princess Estelle, which adds to its importance in Swedish culture. 

If you’re keen on exploring the intersection of history and royal traditions, this chapel is definitely a highlight!
