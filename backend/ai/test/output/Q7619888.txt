Stora Hoparegränd is a charming little alley in Gamla stan, the historic heart of Stockholm. It connects Skeppsbron to Österlånggatan, running parallel to Skottgränd and Drakens gränd. 

The alley has a fascinating history, appearing in records dating back to the 16th century. It carries the name of Michel Hoper, a property owner from that time, and is thought to reflect a profession related to barrel-making. So, if you're walking through the area, Jon, you’re really treading on centuries of history! Plus, it’s a lovely spot for a photo or just to soak in the old-world charm of Stockholm.
