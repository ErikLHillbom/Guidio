Stockholm City Centre is a vibrant hub of history and culture in the heart of Stockholm. This area, known in Swedish as "Stockholms innerstad," is divided into four main boroughs: Kungsholmen, Södermalm, Norrmalm, and Östermalm. Each of these districts has its unique charm and character, offering a mix of historical sites, trendy shops, and lively cultural scenes.

You’ll find that the historical significance of the city is reflected in its architecture and layout, particularly in the old town, Gamla Stan, nestled within the centre. It's fascinating to think that the border between the historical provinces of Södermanland and Uppland runs right through the area, adding another layer to its rich tapestry. You’ll definitely enjoy exploring the streets and soaking in the vibrant atmosphere.
