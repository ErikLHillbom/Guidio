Have you heard about the Greyfriars Monastery, Jon? It’s a fascinating piece of history tucked away on Riddarholmen Island in Stockholm. Founded back in 1270 by King Magnus III, it served the Franciscan Order until the Swedish Reformation in 1527. 

What’s really interesting is how the monastery influenced the area, giving Riddarholmen names like Gråbrödraholm and Munckholmen, which reflect its monastic roots. By the late 15th century, it was a thriving center of knowledge, thanks to figures like Kanutus Johannis who expanded its library. 

After the Reformation, the building went through quite a transformation, serving various purposes, including as a hospital. Today, the only remnant of the abbey is the beautiful Riddarholmen Church. Surprisingly, when excavations happened in 2010, they discovered a complete skeleton of a medieval monk nearby, which adds a real connection to the past. It’s a great spot to soak in the history and culture of Stockholm!
