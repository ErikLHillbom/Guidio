Oh, you’ll love hearing about Göta Lejon! Located at 55 Götgatan in Södermalm, this theatre has a fascinating history. Built between 1926 and 1928 by architect Birger Borgström, the venue showcases a striking neoclassical modernist style.

Originally opened as a cinema in 1928, it transitioned to a theatre in the 1990s and has since become well-known for musical productions. Some highlights include Swedish versions of classics like *The Sound of Music* and *Jesus Christ Superstar*. 

You might find it interesting, Jon, that it has hosted a range of artists over the years, from rock legends like AC/DC to more contemporary acts. It’s a true gem of Stockholm’s cultural scene!
