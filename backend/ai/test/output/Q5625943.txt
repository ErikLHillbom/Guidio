You know, Gåstorget is quite a charming little spot in Gamla stan, Stockholm's historic heart. This small public square, nestled between Överskärargränd and Gåsgränd, has a rich history dating back to 1796 when it was initially created to accommodate horse-drawn vehicles—pretty essential for fire fighting back in the day!

Interestingly, this area was informally known as "Goose Plain" long before it received the official name Gåstorget. And if you happen to wander there, you won’t want to miss the bronze sculpture called "Tungviktare" by Sven Lundqvist, which adds a lovely artistic touch to the square. It's a perfect spot for a quick cultural stop, Jon!
