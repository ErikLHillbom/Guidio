Oh, you're going to love Vasabron, Jon! This beautiful bridge connects Norrmalm to Gamla Stan, the charming old town of Stockholm. Named after King Gustav Vasa, it’s not just a vital connection but also a piece of history. 

Constructed between 1872 and 1878, it features seven arches and was innovative for its time, using underwater cast concrete and cast steel for the first time. The bridge spans 208 meters and originally solved the issue of traffic with the rapidly growing city in the mid-19th century. 

While it was designed to be wide, its connection to the narrow streets of Gamla Stan creates a bit of a quirky detour around the Bonde Palace. It’s a perfect spot to take in the historical architecture and the vibrant culture surrounding you. It’s fascinating how a structure can tell so much about a city's evolution, right?
