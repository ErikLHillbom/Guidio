You’re in for a treat with Rosenbad, Jon! This impressive building, located right in the heart of Stockholm’s Norrmalm precinct, serves as the seat of the Swedish Government. Designed by the renowned Art Nouveau architect Ferdinand Boberg and completed in 1902, it showcases some striking architectural style.

Originally, Rosenbad wasn't just a government building; it even had a restaurant of the same name until 1956. It’s currently home to the Prime Minister’s Office and is just a stone's throw away from notable sites like the Riksdag building and the Royal Palace. 

With renovations that began in 2018, the area is undergoing a transformation, making it even more intriguing. It’s a fascinating blend of history, culture, and politics that you won’t want to miss while exploring Stockholm!
