You know, Jon, if you're wandering around Gamla stan, you should definitely check out Själagårdsgatan. This charming street runs from Köpmangatan down to Tyska Brunnsplan, and it’s got a rich history. 

It dates back to the early 15th century and was named after a charitable institution known as "Själagård," which was like a home for the elderly and sick. This place was quite significant back in the day, funded by donations from the community. Over the years, it transformed into a royal printing house and later a school. Isn’t it fascinating how a single street can have so many layers of history?

The name has changed a bit over the centuries, though, and at one point, people even referred to it as "Skärgårdsgatan," meaning "The Archipelago Street." It was officially renamed back in 1925. If you're interested in history and culture, this little street will certainly add to your experience of Stockholm!
