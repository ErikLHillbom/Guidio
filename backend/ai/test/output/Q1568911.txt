Have you had a chance to check out Norrbro yet? This stunning arch bridge stretches over the Norrström River right in the heart of Stockholm. It's a pretty significant piece of history, designed by Erik Palmstedt in a neoclassical style. 

Norrbro was one of the first stone bridges in the city, completed in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. It replaced two wooden bridges and was notable for its impressive width and elegant arches. You'll love the fact that it was also the first street in Stockholm to be paved with separate pavements, which adds to its charm.

Oh, and the innovative construction method used to build the bridge is fascinating too—using a submerged barge technique! It’s definitely a must-see for someone like you who appreciates history and culture, Jon. Plus, the views from the bridge are pretty spectacular, especially with the Royal Palace and the Riksdag building in the background.
