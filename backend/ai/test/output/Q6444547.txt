You’ll love Kungsbron, a fascinating piece of Stockholm's history! This double bridge connects Norrmalm to Kungsholmen, spanning over Klara Sjö. Originally, an old wooden bridge was replaced in 1881 by a steel swing bridge, which was quite the engineering feat back in its day. 

By 1907, they added a beautiful steel arch bridge on top of the original. It's interesting to note that the swing bridge was replaced in 1944 with two modern concrete arch bridges. This whole structure continues the legacy of Kungsgatan, named in honor of its royal connections, as it crosses Drottninggatan, or "The Queen Street."

So, Jon, if you’re into history and culture, this bridge is a perfect spot to explore and appreciate the evolution of Stockholm's infrastructure!
