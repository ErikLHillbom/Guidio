You’ll definitely want to check out Bedoirsgränd while you’re in Gamla stan, Jon. This charming alley runs between Västerlånggatan and Stora Nygatan, and it’s rich in history. Did you know it’s named after Jean Bedoire the Younger? He was a prominent merchant in the 18th century, known for dominating the Swedish salt market and even banking for royalty like Charles XII. 

The alley itself has been around for quite a while—its name first appeared on a map in 1733, but it was mentioned even earlier in 1581. You can see some interesting features from that era too, like the Rococo portal at Number 2. It’s a great spot to soak in some of Stockholm’s history and culture!
