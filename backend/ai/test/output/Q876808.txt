You know, Jon, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Stockholm is quite an interesting piece of history in Sweden. Established in the wake of the Protestant Reformation, it's the only Catholic diocese that has been set up in the country since then. It covers the entire nation and consists of 44 parishes.

The heart of the diocese is Saint Eric's Cathedral, located right here in Stockholm. It’s fascinating to think that before the Reformation, there were several Catholic dioceses in Sweden, but over time, they transitioned to being part of the Church of Sweden. 

The diocese has a rich history, having been part of various ecclesiastical jurisdictions over the centuries. It wasn't until 1953 that it was officially designated as the Diocese of Stockholm. The fact that it has managed to maintain its presence and community in Sweden, now supporting around 150,000 Catholics of diverse backgrounds, is a testament to its resilience. It’s definitely a key part of the cultural tapestry here, don’t you think?
