You’ll love exploring Stadshusbron, Jon! This bridge, also known as the City Hall Bridge, is a significant historical landmark in central Stockholm. It connects the bustling mainland of Norrmalm to the picturesque island of Kungsholmen, right next to the iconic Stockholm City Hall.

The bridge has quite a history, dating back to the 17th century when the first bridge was built due to the population growth on Kungsholmen. Can you believe that initial structure was a 500-meter-long pontoon bridge and was likely the longest bridge in Europe at the time? It’s fascinating how it was rebuilt a couple of times, evolving from a simple pontoon to the steel swing bridge in 1868 and finally to the drawbridge we see today, completed in the early 20th century.

If you enjoy history and culture, this spot is definitely worth a visit!
