You know, Jon, right here in Stockholm you can find an impressive sculpture called "The Knife Wrestlers," created by Johan Peter Molin in the mid-19th century. It's a striking piece that depicts two men in a knife fight, which was a breakthrough for the artist. 

What’s fascinating is that it draws from a mythological duel style called "spänna bälte," where fighters are bound together by a belt. The details are rich, too; the sculpture features relief images that tell the dramatic story of their fight, adorned with snake ornaments and ancient Nordic runes. 

Molin worked on this piece for years, and it really gained recognition at the 1862 International Exhibition in London. There are several copies around Sweden, including one right in front of the National Museum, which you might want to check out. It's not just a sculpture; it reflects a unique blend of history and culture that makes it a significant piece in Swedish art.
