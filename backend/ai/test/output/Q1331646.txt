You’ll love checking out Medelhavsmuseet, Jon! This museum is right in central Stockholm and focuses on fascinating ancient artifacts from the Mediterranean and Near East. It’s part of the National Museums of World Culture, which gives it a unique place in Sweden’s cultural landscape. 

The museum has a rich history itself, having merged the Egyptian Museum and the Cyprus Collection back in 1954. The Cyprus Collection is particularly impressive, being the largest outside of Cyprus. You can even see eight mummified ancient Egyptians there, including one named Neswaiu. 

The collections also feature Greek, Roman, and Islamic art, so there’s definitely a lot of history and culture to soak up while you explore!
