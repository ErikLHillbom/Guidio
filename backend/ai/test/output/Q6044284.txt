You know, Jon, while you’re here in Stockholm, you might want to check out the Intendenturförrådet on Skeppsholmen. This building has a fascinating history! Designed by architect Johan Eberhard Carlberg in the early 18th century, it was originally built as a warehouse to store grains and goods collected from taxes. 

What's really interesting is that it’s the only historical structure on Skeppsholmen that wasn’t used by the Navy. Its plain exterior stands in stark contrast to the more opulent Stockholm Palace just across the water. Plus, it’s one of the few buildings in the city that remains unaltered since its construction. So if you're into history and architecture, this spot should definitely be on your list!
