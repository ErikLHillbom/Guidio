You know, Jon, if you're interested in history and culture, the Pernby School of Painting in Stockholm is a fascinating spot. Originally founded in 1927 as Otte Skölds Art School, it was led by Otte Sköld until 1949 when he became the director of the Nationalmuseum. Åke Pernby then took over as rector, and that’s when the school was renamed.

It offers a two-year training program in painting, which prepares students for higher education in Fine Arts. Plus, it’s a place that has nurtured notable artists, like Erik Wennerstrand. It’s definitely a significant part of Stockholm's artistic heritage!
