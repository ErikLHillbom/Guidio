There's a really unique spot in Stockholm that I think you’d enjoy—the Avicii Experience. This museum is a heartfelt tribute to the renowned Swedish music producer Tim Bergling, known as Avicii. It opened in February 2022 and is designed to celebrate his life and work while also addressing important issues like mental health.

What’s fascinating about the Avicii Experience, Jon, is how it immerses visitors in his journey. You can check out reconstructions of his childhood bedroom and even his Los Angeles mansion. There are interactive exhibits that let you remix some of his most popular tracks and hear unreleased music. It really captures both his creative process and the high-paced lifestyle he led before his retirement from touring in 2016.

Plus, the museum is dedicated to raising awareness about mental health, with a portion of the profits going to the Tim Bergling Foundation. It’s a blend of history, culture, and a meaningful mission, making it a significant stop while you’re in the city!
