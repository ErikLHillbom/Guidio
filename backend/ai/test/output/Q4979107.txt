You know, Brunnsgränd is a fascinating little spot in Gamla stan, Jon. It’s the widest alley in the old town and connects Skeppsbron to Österlånggatan. The name translates to "Well Alley," and it dates back to at least 1526, when it was referred to as "brundzgrenden." 

It’s intriguing because it was named after a water well that was mentioned as far back as 1461. While you won't find that well there today, it’s a reminder of how this area was once the center of daily life. Historically, this alley was part of a bustling square known as Fisketorget, which connected to the main square, Stortorget. So, if you’re keen on history and culture, strolling through Brunnsgränd will certainly give you a sense of the rich past that this charming part of Stockholm holds.
