As we explore central Stockholm, you’ll definitely want to check out Centralpalatset. This striking building, designed by architect Ernst Stenhammar, has quite the history—constructed between 1896 and 1998, it now houses the Ministry of the Environment. If you’re feeling hungry, there’s also a fantastic Japanese restaurant called Seikoen on the ground floor. It’s a neat blend of culture and history right in the heart of Norrmalm, Jon!
