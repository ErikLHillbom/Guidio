You know, Jon, if you're exploring Gamla stan, you shouldn’t miss Ankargränd, or "Anchor Alley." It’s a charming little alley that connects Trångsund and Prästgatan, just a stone's throw from the Storkyrkan church. 

What’s really fascinating is the history behind its name. It comes from a simple eatery called Ankaret, which was run by Marcus Andersson Ankar back in the late 17th century. The alley was first mentioned in 1731, before which it didn’t even have a name! 

The building at Number 5 has a striking Rococo design, dating back to 1772, still keeping that old-world charm with its rounded corners and small barred windows. Plus, if you're into culture, the Cornelis Vreeswijk Museum is right there on Ankargränd, adding to the area's rich historical vibe. It’s a perfect spot to soak in the culture and history of Stockholm!
