You’re going to love Blekholmsbron, Jon! This pedestrian bridge in central Stockholm is not just a functional crossing over Klara Sjö; it’s steeped in history. At about 55 meters long, it connects Norrmalm to Kungsholmen, making it a great spot to stroll and take in the views.

The name "Blekholmsbron" comes from the small islet that was once here, known for its use in fabric bleaching back in the day. It’s fascinating to think about how this area has transformed since the 17th century. While you're there, you might also want to check out some of the nearby bridges, like Kungsbron and Sankt Eriksbron. It’s a lovely little cultural spot in the heart of the city!
