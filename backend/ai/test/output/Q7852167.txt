You know, Jon, Tullgränd is quite a charming little alley in Gamla stan, which is the old town of Stockholm. It connects Skeppsbron to Österlånggatan and runs parallel to Packhusgränd and Norra Bankogränd. 

The history here is fascinating! It dates back to at least the early 17th century, originally appearing in records as "Tollhuus grenden" in 1626, a nod to the customs activities in the area. The name Tullgränd, meaning "Customs Alley," comes from the Customs Building that was established nearby in 1686. By the early 1700s, it even picked up a nickname, "Solgränden," after a tavern called Lilla Solen. It’s a perfect spot to stroll if you appreciate a mix of culture and history.
