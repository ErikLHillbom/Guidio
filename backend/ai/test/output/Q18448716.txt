If you’re interested in history and culture, the Swedish Museum of Performing Arts is definitely worth a visit, Jon! Located in Stockholm, this museum showcases a fascinating blend of dance, music, and theatre. It was formerly known as the Music and Theater Museum until 2017 when it rebranded, and it’s filled with an impressive collection of about 60,000 objects. 

What’s particularly cool is that the museum tells a story through its exhibits rather than following a strict timeline. You’ll find everything from stage designs to handwritten song texts, and even a staggering 6,000 musical instruments! Plus, since the reopening, they've added interactive features, like the *gestrument*, where you can actually create music through movement. It’s a unique experience that really brings the performing arts to life!
