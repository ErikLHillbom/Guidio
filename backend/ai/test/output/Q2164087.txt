You’ll love visiting the German Church, or Tyska kyrkan, in Gamla Stan, Jon! This historic church, dedicated to Saint Gertrude, was established in the 14th century by German merchants, reflecting the significant German presence in medieval Stockholm.

As you explore, you'll notice its striking Neogothic architecture, including a tall steeple with unique gargoyles. The church has served as a vibrant center for music and community over the centuries, even housing a German school until 1888. 

Inside, the Baroque interior is bright and inviting, with large windows and beautiful artwork, like the impressive altar by Markus Hebel. Don't miss the painted windows that tell stories of devotion and the king's gallery, which has seen many royal families attend services. It’s a fantastic spot to soak up some history and culture!
