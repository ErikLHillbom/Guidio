Oh, Jon, you’ll really appreciate Östermalmstorg metro station. It’s not just a regular stop; it’s a deep dive into Stockholm's history and culture. Opened back in 1965, it was the first part of the red line extension from T-Centralen and quickly became one of the busiest stations, with around 38,550 daily travelers.

What’s particularly fascinating is that it’s about 38 meters underground, built right into the Stockholm bedrock. The station is also home to some significant artwork by Siri Derkert, which highlights themes like women's rights and world peace. It’s designed with a unique purpose, even serving as a potential shelter during crises. Plus, its location in the heart of the city makes it a great starting point for exploring Östermalm and beyond. It’s a perfect blend of function and culture that I think you’ll enjoy!
