Mälartorget is a charming public square nestled in the heart of Gamla stan, right on the waterfront facing Lake Mälaren. It’s interesting to know, Jon, that this square came into existence in the mid-19th century, originally serving as a spot for unloading agricultural goods brought to the city from the surrounding regions. 

Historically, this area had a rather colorful past, known as Flugmötet, which referred to the rather unfortunate practice of emptying city latrines nearby. Thankfully, those days are long behind us! 

Today, the square features the bronze sculpture called "Familjen" by Pye Engström. This piece, made in the early 1970s, captures a family and allows visitors to interact with it by moving the figures along tracks in the base. It’s a lovely spot to soak in some of Stockholm’s rich history and culture while enjoying the view of the serene lake.
