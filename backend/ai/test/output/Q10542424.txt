Have you ever been to Kafé 44? It’s such a unique spot in Stockholm! This place is not just a café; it’s also a concert venue and an anarchist bookstore, all rolled into one. It’s part of the Kapsylen work cooperative, which was started by an artist group back in 1976. 

The café, known as Dagfiket, opened in the early '80s, and then they added the music venue, Scen 44, in 1990. A few years later, they introduced the bookstore, Bokhandeln INFO, which adds to its cultural vibe. They really embrace the spirit of community and alternative culture, hosting everything from punk shows to lectures. Just a heads-up, though, if you’re planning to visit during the summer, keep in mind that they usually close for the season. It’s definitely a spot to check out if you’re interested in history and culture!
