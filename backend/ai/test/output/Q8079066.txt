You’ll really enjoy exploring Österlånggatan, especially since you're into history and culture. This charming street is located in Gamla stan, the historic heart of Stockholm. Stretching from Slottsbacken down to Järntorget, it has a fascinating past.

One standout feature is the statue of Saint George and the Dragon found on Köpmanbrinken, a delightful spot that adds a fairytale touch. Also, don’t miss the restaurant Den Gyldene Freden at number 51. Established in 1722, it's recognized as one of the oldest restaurants in the world with its original interior still intact. Imagine dining where locals and travelers have gathered for centuries!

As you stroll along, you’ll notice Österlånggatan has transformed from its bustling tavern days into a quieter shopping street, yet it retains its historical charm. There’s a lot to absorb, Jon, with every corner telling a story of Stockholm’s rich past.
