Olof Palme, the Prime Minister of Sweden, was tragically assassinated on February 28, 1986, while walking home from the cinema with his wife, Lisbeth, on Sveavägen in central Stockholm. It was a shocking moment in Swedish history, as Palme was shot in the back at close range, and Lisbeth was also injured by a second shot. The couple was unaccompanied by bodyguards, which was unusual given his position.

After a lengthy investigation, in 2020, the focus shifted to a man named Stig Engström, often referred to as the "Skandia Man," who had a history of being near the scene. However, he had already passed away in 2000, and the evidence against him was circumstantial, leading to considerable debate and criticism about the findings.

Palme's assassination sparked national mourning, with flags at half-staff and his funeral drawing dignitaries from around the world. It remains one of Sweden's most infamous unsolved crimes, with various theories and suspects proposed over the years, showcasing the event's deep impact on Swedish culture and history. It’s a fascinating, albeit somber, chapter that still resonates in the collective memory of the nation.
