You know, Jon, if you're interested in history and culture, you should definitely check out the site of Makalös, which was once the grand mansion of the De la Gardie family. Completed in 1653, it was a stunning example of aristocratic architecture right by the Norrström, close to the Royal Palace. 

This five-story palace was adorned with beautiful stone masonry, copper roofing, and had lavish interiors complete with stucco decorations and galleries of paintings. It really stood out in its time, and the De la Gardie family called it the "great house."

Interestingly, after its construction, it served various purposes, even becoming a venue for the Royal Dramatic Theatre in 1793. Sadly, a fire during a performance in 1825 led to its destruction. While the original building is gone, some artifacts can be found at the nearby Kungsträdgården metro station, and there's a scale model of Makalös at the Stockholm City Museum if you want to see what it looked like. It’s a fascinating piece of history right here in Stockholm!
