If you're interested in unique cultural approaches in education, Egalia in Södermalm is quite fascinating. Opened in 2010, this preschool has garnered attention for its innovative methods, particularly its emphasis on gender-neutral language. Instead of using "him" or "her," children are encouraged to use "friend" or the pronoun "hen," which is quite reflective of a Finnish influence.

The school focuses on providing a diverse range of literature, steering clear of traditional gender roles and showcasing stories about gay couples, single parents, and adopted children. It's a progressive environment that aims to challenge societal norms from a young age. 

There's been some controversy surrounding its methods, with critics labeling it as indoctrination. However, the school maintains that promoting gender equality is a necessary part of modern education. It's definitely a unique spot in Stockholm's cultural landscape, wouldn't you say, Jon?
