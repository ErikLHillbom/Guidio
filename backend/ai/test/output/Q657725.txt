You’ll love exploring SoFo, Jon! It’s a trendy area in Södermalm, right south of Folkungagatan. This neighborhood has been rebranded by local entrepreneurs to showcase innovative Swedish fashion and creative industries. It's known for its hip vibe, attracting many designers and media companies.

You might also enjoy Nytorget, a charming city square with a playground and park, perfect for a little break. Another spot worth checking out is Vita Bergen, which offers beautiful views of the city and has an open-air theatre during the summer.

If you’re around at the end of the month, don’t miss SoFo night! Many shops stay open late, offering a lively atmosphere with free entertainment and refreshments. It's a great way to dive into the local culture.
