You’ve got to check out Svartmangatan while you’re exploring Gamla Stan, Jon! This street, which translates to "Black Man Street," has a rich history dating back to 1437, making it one of Stockholm's oldest thoroughfares. It originally led from the central square, Stortorget, to the abbey of the Blackfriars. 

The name has changed over the centuries, reflecting its connection to the Dominican monks who once inhabited the area. It's fascinating how the street evolved alongside the city’s history! Today, it connects various smaller streets, and you'll find it runs parallel to other notable streets, adding to the charm of the old town. Definitely a must-see for someone like you who appreciates history and culture!
