Västra Trädgårdsgatan is a charming street in Norrmalm, Stockholm, stretching from Kungsträdgården to Hamngatan. If you're into history and culture, Jon, you'll appreciate that it's home to the Matchstick Palace, which adds a unique touch to the area. It’s a lovely place to stroll and soak in the atmosphere of this vibrant part of the city!
