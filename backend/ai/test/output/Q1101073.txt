Oh, you're going to love Parliament House, Jon! It’s the seat of the Swedish parliament, known as the Riksdag, and it's beautifully situated on Helgeandsholmen island in the historic Gamla stan district. The building itself is an architectural gem, designed in the Neoclassical style by Aron Johansson, with a striking Baroque Revival facade. 

Constructed between 1897 and 1905, it replaced the older Riksdag building and was designed to host not only the parliament but also the Swedish National Bank initially. After a significant transformation in 1971, the Assembly Hall was created there, making it a key location for political discussions in Sweden.

The building is not just about politics; it has also hosted the Right Livelihood Award ceremony, which honors those tackling urgent global challenges. So, if you're into history and culture, this spot is definitely worth a visit!
