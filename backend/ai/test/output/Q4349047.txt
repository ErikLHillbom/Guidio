You know, Jon, if you're interested in history and culture, you should definitely check out the Admiralty House on Skeppsholmen. This intriguing building dates back to 1647-50 and was originally designed by Dutch architect Louis Gillis. It's a great example of Dutch Renaissance architecture, even though only the limestone portal remains from that time.

Over the years, it has served various purposes, including an archive and even a corn stable. It transformed into a barrack in 1794, and later underwent a redesign in the mid-1800s, adding those charming turrets we see today. Interestingly, it was rebuilt in 1952 to house the Admiralty again, but nowadays it's home to the Swedish Institute of International Affairs. It's definitely a spot that encapsulates a lot of Stockholm's rich history!
