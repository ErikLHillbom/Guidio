You know, if you're looking for a slice of history, Fem små hus is an absolute must-visit in Gamla stan. This classic restaurant, whose name means "five small houses," has been around since at least 1694. It's actually considered the oldest continuously operating restaurant in Sweden and the third oldest in the world! 

Located at the corner of Nygränd and Österlånggatan, Fem små hus serves up traditional Swedish cuisine with a hint of French flair. In the winter, it’s an evening-only spot, but come summer, they offer lunch too. 

What’s really fascinating, Jon, is that the restaurant is housed in five historical buildings, with remnants of the original architecture still visible in the cellar vaults. You can enjoy a meal in a place that has been serving patrons for hundreds of years—how cool is that?
