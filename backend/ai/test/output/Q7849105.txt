You know, Jon, there’s a charming little alley called Trädgårdstvärgränd in Gamla stan, the old town of Stockholm. It runs parallel to some other quaint streets and connects Köpmangatan to Trädgårdsgatan. 

What’s fascinating about it is its history—this area used to be filled with vegetable gardens back in the 16th century, belonging to properties next to the Royal Palace. The name itself translates to "Garden's Cross-Alley," reflecting its agricultural past. The alley remained nameless for quite a while until it began to be referred to as Trädgårdstvärgränd in the 18th century. 

If you’re wandering around Stortorget or the nearby Slottsbacken, it’s worth a quick stroll to soak in a bit of that historical vibe!
