You know, Jon, if you're curious about historic buildings in Stockholm, Norra Latin is definitely worth a visit. This site, completed in 1880, was originally a boys' school known for its focus on Greek, Latin, and classical studies. It was created through a merger of several schools and, interestingly enough, it didn’t start admitting girls until 1961, despite a resolution in 1918 for co-education.

The architecture is stunning too. Designed in a Neo-Renaissance style, it's reminiscent of a Florentine Renaissance palace with beautiful glazed atriums and Romanesque arcade passageways. After its school days ended in 1982, it became a conference center, but as of August 2023, it has returned to its roots as the Stockholm International School.

So, if you have time, it might be fascinating to check out both the building and its rich history!
