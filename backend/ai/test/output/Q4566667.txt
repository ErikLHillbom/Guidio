You know, Järntorget is quite a gem in Gamla stan, the old town of Stockholm. It’s the second oldest square in the city and dates back to around 1300, making it a fascinating stop for anyone interested in history like you, Jon. Originally called Korntorget, the square evolved from a bustling market for barley to a center for the iron trade by the 16th century.

As you stroll around Järntorget, you’ll notice how it connects several key thoroughfares and alleys that lead to different parts of the old town. The area was historically alive with commerce, filled with the sounds and smells of trade as goods moved between the water and the market.

One of the highlights is the Södra Bankohuset, which is the world’s oldest national bank building. Its architecture is inspired by the Italian Renaissance—definitely a sight to see! You’ll also find a statue of Evert Taube, a beloved Swedish troubadour, right in front of the bank, which adds a nice cultural touch to the square.

Walking through Järntorget, you can almost feel the pulse of history beneath your feet. It’s a perfect spot for you to soak in Stockholm’s rich heritage!
