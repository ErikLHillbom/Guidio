You know, Jon, Klarabergsviadukten is quite an interesting piece of architecture in central Stockholm. It’s a reinforced concrete bridge that connects Norrmalm to Kungsholmen, stretching over Klara Sjö. The name translates to "The Viaduct of Hill of St Clare," which has a nice ring to it, don't you think?

Originally proposed in 1928, the bridge was meant to be part of a broader traffic route, connecting the central railway yard with the suburbs. It took a while, but it finally opened in 1961, with its design evolving significantly from the initial plans. The bridge spans a total of 106 meters and includes various sections, with its longest span reaching 41 meters over the lake.

It’s interesting to note that since it never quite fulfilled its intended purpose as a motorway, parts of the structure have been repurposed for parking. So, if you're in the area, it’s a fascinating blend of history and utility to check out!
