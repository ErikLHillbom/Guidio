Hey Jon! If you're interested in history and culture, Norrmalm is a fascinating area to explore in Stockholm. This district, first mentioned in 1288, has a rich history that includes a brief stint as an independent city in the early 1600s.

Today, Lower Norrmalm, often referred to as the City, is the bustling heart of Stockholm, while Upper Norrmalm features a more residential vibe. The area underwent significant redevelopment in the 1950s and 60s, which transformed parts of it into a modern urban space, resulting in iconic spots like Sergels torg, a large public plaza.

It's a unique blend of history and modernity, offering a glimpse into Stockholm's past and present. I think you’d really enjoy wandering through this vibrant district!
