You know, Jon, Stockholms Lyceum has quite an interesting history! This private secondary school operated in Stockholm from 1839 until 1875. It was founded by Claes Olof Ramström and became known for its progressive educational approach, allowing students to engage in discussions and even challenge their teachers—quite a departure from the stricter public schools of the time.

During its years of operation, the school had about 1,426 students, with a notable number going on to attend university or the Karlberg War Academy. Some famous alumni include the author August Strindberg and the poet Carl Snoilsky, who both left a significant mark on Swedish literature.

It’s fascinating to think about how the Lyceum fostered a liberal and democratic spirit among its students, especially given the era it was in. If you're exploring Stockholm's educational history, this place definitely stands out!
