Oh, you’re going to love the Matchstick Palace! Situated right on Västra Trädgårdsgatan, this striking office building was commissioned by the so-called "Match King," Ivar Kreuger, back in the late 1920s. Designed by architect Ivar Tengbom, it served as the headquarters for the Swedish match company, Svenska Tändsticks AB.

What really stands out, Jon, is the building’s beautiful façade, dressed in ornate marble, and its unique horseshoe-shaped inner courtyard which features the lovely Diana fountain by sculptor Carl Milles. The interior is just as captivating, especially the board meeting room adorned with paintings by the expressionist artist Isaac Grünewald.

It’s fascinating how the Matchstick Palace has been through a few ownerships over the years, and it even returned to its roots when Swedish Match moved back in a few years ago. So, if you appreciate history and culture, this place definitely has some interesting stories to tell!
