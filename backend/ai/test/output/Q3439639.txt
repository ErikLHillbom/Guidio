Ah, Kreditbanken, or Sveriges Kreditbank, is quite an interesting piece of history here in Stockholm. Founded way back in 1923 as Jordbrukarbanken, it played a significant role in the banking scene. In 1974, it merged with the Post Bank to become PK-Banken, which later acquired Nordbanken in 1980. Eventually, it adopted the Nordbanken name and became part of Nordea, which is a major player today.

Interestingly, this location is also tied to the infamous Norrmalmstorg robbery, which is where the term "Stockholm syndrome" originated. So, if you’re keen on a blend of banking history and a unique cultural moment, this spot has some captivating stories to offer! Plus, the Nobis Hotel occupies part of the building now, blending the old with the new. What do you think, Jon?
