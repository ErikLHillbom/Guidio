Katarina Church is a fascinating piece of Stockholm's history that you might really enjoy, Jon. Originally built between 1656 and 1695, it’s one of the city’s major churches. The church has a rich past, having faced destruction from fires, with a significant rebuild in the 1990s after a fire nearly leveled it.

It was named after Princess Catherine, the mother of King Charles X Gustav. The church features an impressive octagonal tower, which was added during its rebuilding after a major fire in 1723. As you walk around, you can also explore the cemetery where notable figures like Foreign Minister Anna Lindh are buried.

One striking feature is Karl XII's Stair, a beautifully designed staircase leading up to the church's entrance, dedicated to King Charles XII. The ornate railing and the engraved poem add a unique touch to the site, reflecting its historical significance.

If you're looking to immerse yourself in the culture and history of Stockholm, visiting Katarina Church is definitely a worthwhile stop!
