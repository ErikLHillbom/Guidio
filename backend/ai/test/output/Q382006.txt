You’ll definitely want to check out the Af Chapman while you're in Stockholm, Jon. This full-rigged steel ship has quite the history! Originally launched in 1888 as the Dunboyne, it has sailed from Europe to Australia and even the west coast of North America. 

In its later years, the ship was acquired by the Swedish Navy, which renamed it after the notable shipbuilder Fredrik Henrik af Chapman. Now, it serves a different purpose—housing a youth hostel with 285 beds, making it a unique spot for travelers. 

You can also enjoy the stunning views from the western shore of Skeppsholmen where it’s moored. It’s a great blend of maritime history and modern-day culture—perfect for your interests!
