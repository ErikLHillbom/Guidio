If you’re looking to dive into the history and culture of Sweden, the National Library of Sweden is definitely a must-see, Jon. Known as the Kungliga biblioteket, this impressive institution collects and preserves all printed and audio-visual materials in Swedish, along with works tied to Sweden published abroad. 

Imagine exploring a collection that boasts over 18 million items, from books and manuscripts to audio-visual recordings. The library’s history dates back to the reign of King Gustav Vasa in the 16th century, where royal collections began to form, and it has grown through legal deposits and acquisitions ever since.

It’s fascinating how the library also has a significant focus on foreign literature and even maintains a digital archive of the Swedish web! Plus, its impressive building in Humlegården is worth the visit alone. You’ll find auditoriums, exhibition rooms, and a cozy atmosphere for reading.

So whether you're a history buff or just curious about Sweden's cultural heritage, the National Library will surely capture your interest, Jon!
