You know, Jon, if you’re in the mood for a taste of Swedish culture, Vete-Katten is a must-visit. This charming pastry and coffee shop has been a staple in Stockholm since it opened its doors in 1928. The name, which means "The wheat cat," has an interesting backstory tied to its founder, Ester Nordhammar. 

Located on Kungsgatan, this place is renowned for its traditional Swedish cakes and pastries. It’s fascinating to think that for a long time, the staff were mostly women, which was quite unusual back then. The shop even earned a Gourmet Merit award for its delicious offerings! 

If you’re up for a sweet treat and a glimpse into Sweden’s culinary history, Vete-Katten could be just the spot for you.
