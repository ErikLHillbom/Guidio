You’ll really enjoy visiting Södra Bankohuset, Jon. This historic building, also known as Gamla Riksbanken, is nestled in Gamla stan, the old town of Stockholm. Constructed in stages from 1675 to 1735, it’s the oldest surviving purpose-built central bank office in the world, a fantastic piece of architectural heritage.

The design of the building is quite impressive, with contributions from renowned architects like Nicodemus Tessin the Elder and Younger, as well as Carl Hårleman. Its elegant façade features a mix of Renaissance and Baroque styles, creating a harmonious look that blends with the narrow streets of the old town. You’ll find it facing Järntorget square, which adds to its charm.

Interestingly, the Bank of Sweden operated from this location until 1906, and now, it’s home to Embark Studios. Just thinking about the layers of history this building has seen might captivate you as much as the architecture itself!
