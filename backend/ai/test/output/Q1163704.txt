You know, Jon, Tunnelgatan is quite an interesting spot in Stockholm. It runs from Sveavägen all the way to the Brunkeberg Tunnel, and it’s got a rich history. The street was originally named after an orphanage, but it took on the name Tunnelgatan when the Brunkeberg Tunnel opened back in 1886. 

One fascinating tidbit is that Tunnelgatan was once the site of a ropewalk in the 17th century. If you’re into historical architecture, you might appreciate the lone residential building at the corner of Tunnelgatan and Luntmakargatan, which dates back to the late 1800s.

It’s also tied to a significant event in Swedish history—the murder of Olof Palme occurred nearby. This part of the street has since been renamed Olof Palmes gata, adding another layer of cultural significance.

If you’re exploring the area, it’s a great little slice of Stockholm’s past!
