You know, Jon, if you're wandering through Gamla stan, you might come across Fru Gunillas Gränd. This historical alley used to connect Skeppsbron and Österlånggatan but has been closed off for quite some time now. It's fascinating to think about how, back in the 17th century, many of these alleys were often tied up in legal disputes, with property owners blocking access to use them for their own purposes. 

Interestingly, it was once known as Doktor Belows gränd, hinting at some drama between its proprietors! The alley was named after Gunilla Johansdotter Bese, a significant figure, and even had ties to the royal family. It’s a little hidden gem of history, showcasing the rich culture of Stockholm. Definitely worth a peek if you're into stories from the past!
