Stora Nygatan is a fascinating street in Gamla stan, the historic heart of Stockholm, where you'll really feel the echoes of the past, Jon. This street was established in the early 1630s as part of a reconstruction plan after a devastating fire. It has seen a lot of history, including the time when the famous troubadour Carl Michael Bellman lived at number 1 and number 20 during the late 18th century.

As you stroll down Stora Nygatan, you can’t help but admire its charming architecture and imagine the vibrant life that once filled the taverns and social clubs. Number two, for instance, has a rich history as a tavern and brothel frequented by Bellman and other literary figures. It truly captures the essence of Swedish culture and heritage. If you’re keen on history and culture, this street is definitely worth a visit!
