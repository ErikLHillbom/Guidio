Bollhusgränd is a charming alley in Gamla stan, the old town of Stockholm, that Jon might find intriguing due to its rich history. It connects Slottsbacken to Köpmantorget and is named after a historical theater called Bollhuset. 

What’s fascinating is that this alley used to run along the eastern city wall, connecting significant sites like the Three Crowns castle and the Blackfriars monastery. You can also spot notable buildings like the Tessin Palace, which adds to its historical vibe. 

As you walk through, you’ll notice how the alley widens at certain points, creating a picturesque scene perfect for a stroll. Plus, if you’re curious about old eateries, the Royal Coin Cabinet now occupies a location that was once home to one of the best restaurants in town! It's a lovely spot to soak in Stockholm’s culture and history, don’t you think, Jon?
