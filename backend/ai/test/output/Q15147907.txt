You know, Jon, just below the northern facade of Stockholm Palace, there are these intriguing bronze sculptures called Slottslejonen, or "The Castle Lions." They stand proudly on Lejonbacken, and each lion rests its left paw on a globe, which is a fascinating detail.

What’s really interesting is that they’re not identical; one faces east while the other looks west, but both gaze northward. They were crafted by the French sculptor Bernard Foucquet the Elder between 1702 and 1704, inspired by the historic Medici lions. They were placed there as a symbol of royal power, with the bronze sourced from war booty during a campaign in Denmark. Quite a rich history, don't you think?
