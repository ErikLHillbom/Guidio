Klara sjö is a fascinating canal right in the heart of Stockholm, separating the island of Kungsholmen from the lively district of Norrmalm. It’s not only a beautiful waterway but also rich in history and culture. This canal connects Barnhusviken to Riddarfjärden and has its roots as a lake before land fill transformed it into the strait we see today.

What’s quite interesting for someone like you, Jon, is that the canal is bordered by several notable bridges, including the Stadshusbron, which plays a role in limiting the height of boats passing through. Plus, you’ll find iconic landmarks nearby, like the impressive Stockholm City Hall, which is a must-see for any history enthusiast. 

The name Klara sjö actually harks back to a former monastery dedicated to Saint Clare, reflecting its rich past. It's a perfect spot to soak in the city’s culture while enjoying a scenic stroll by the water!
