You know, Jon, the Battle of Brunkeberg is a fascinating piece of Swedish history. It took place on October 10, 1471, when Sten Sture the Elder, who was recently elected as the Lord Protector of Sweden, faced off against Danish King Christian I. Sture's strategic plan was brilliant; he coordinated attacks from multiple directions, which ultimately led to a decisive victory that weakened the Kalmar Union significantly.

Interestingly, the roots of this battle were largely economic and political, with many of the combatants on both sides being Swedish. After the victory, Sture solidified his power as regent, and legend has it that he prayed to Saint George before the battle. To commemorate this, he later commissioned a stunning statue of Saint George and the Dragon, which you can find in Stockholm’s Storkyrkan church.

If you’re ever in the area, there’s even a modern monument dedicated to the battle, unveiled on its anniversary in 1912. It really reflects the long-standing narrative of Sweden's struggle for independence. What do you think, Jon? Would you like to dive deeper into any other historical events or locations?
