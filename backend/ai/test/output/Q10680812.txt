You’ll love checking out the Stomatol Sign while you’re in Stockholm. It’s actually Sweden's first animated commercial display, and believe it or not, it’s still operational after all these years! Erected back in 1909 on the old Katarina Elevator, this unique sign showcases a toothbrush and a toothpaste tube from the Swedish brand Stomatol. It’s a fascinating piece of history that adds to the cultural charm of the Slussenområdet. I think you’ll find it intriguing, Jon!
