You know, Jon, if you're curious about Sweden's labor history, IF Metall is quite an interesting topic. This trade union was formed in 2006 through a merger of the Swedish Industrial Union and the Metalworkers' Union, but its roots date all the way back to 1888. 

It's pretty significant, representing a diverse range of workers across various sectors like mechanical engineering, mining, and even the textile industry. What's remarkable is that it has a membership density of 80%, although the total members have declined over the years.

Also, recently, IF Metall has been in the news due to a strike involving mechanics at Tesla's service subsidiary—it's even marked as the longest strike in Sweden in over eighty years! So, if you’re interested in contemporary issues tied to historical contexts, this union is definitely a piece of Sweden's cultural and labor story you might want to explore.
