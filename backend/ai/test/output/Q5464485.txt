Oh, you're going to love this! Just a short stroll away from where you are, you can find the site of Folkan, a historic theatre in Östermalmstorg. Built back in 1856, it was originally known as Ladugårdslandsteatern. Jon, it underwent a few name changes over the years, becoming Bijou-teatern in 1877 and finally Folkan in 1887. 

Sadly, it was demolished in 2008 due to foundation issues, but it played an important role in Stockholm's cultural scene for over a century. If you're into history and culture, it's definitely a spot worth reflecting on as you wander through this vibrant area!
