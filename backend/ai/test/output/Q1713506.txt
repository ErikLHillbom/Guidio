You know, Jon, if you're in Stockholm, you should definitely check out Junibacken. It's a really delightful children's attraction on Djurgården Island, officially opened by the Swedish royal family in 1996. 

What makes it special is its celebration of Swedish children's literature, making it particularly focused on the works of Astrid Lindgren, who created beloved characters like Pippi Longstocking. There’s a charming bronze statue of her outside, and the interior is beautifully designed by Marit Törnqvist, who illustrated some of Lindgren's books.

One of the coolest features is the largest children's bookstore in Sweden right there! As you enter, you’ll notice the lockers shaped like giant book spines, which is quite a quirky touch. There's also a Storybook Square with houses dedicated to various Swedish authors, from Elsa Beskow to Sven Nordqvist.

And don't miss the theme train that takes you through Lindgren's story worlds—it's a magical experience! Plus, they host temporary exhibitions, so there’s always something fresh to see. Junibacken isn’t just a museum; it’s a vibrant homage to the stories that have shaped Swedish culture. I think you'd really enjoy the historical and cultural elements woven throughout this attraction!
