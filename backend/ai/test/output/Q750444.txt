Ah, you're in for a treat with Stockholm Palace, Jon! This stunning royal residence is the official home of the Swedish monarch and stands proudly in Gamla Stan, right next to the Riksdag building. It’s an impressive blend of history and architecture—originally built as a fortress in the 13th century, it has evolved through the centuries into the magnificent palace we see today.

What’s fascinating is that the current building, designed by Nicodemus Tessin the Younger, was constructed after a devastating fire in 1697 destroyed the earlier Tre Kronor Castle. The palace itself was completed in 1754, and it has around 1,430 rooms—each with its own stories and history. You’ll find various apartments for the royal family, as well as grand spaces like the Hall of State and the Royal Chapel.

The exterior is adorned with stunning Baroque elements, and it's surrounded by beautifully landscaped courtyards. Plus, you can admire the changing of the guard, which is a popular attraction—over 800,000 visitors come to the palace each year!

If you're into history and culture, Jon, you’ll definitely find a visit here enriching, with its deep-rooted connections to Sweden's royal heritage and its role in the nation's governance. The stories and the artistry are just waiting to be explored!
