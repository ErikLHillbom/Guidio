You know, Jon, while you’re exploring Gamla stan, you should definitely check out Hebbes Bro. This charming pedestrian bridge connects Riddarholmen and Stadsholmen, offering some lovely views of the old town.

The bridge got its name in 1924, honoring Simon Hebbe, a notable figure who was involved with the East India Company and even played a role in the national trade board. Interestingly, the building next to the bridge was part of the Old Parliament Building until 1905. It’s a little piece of history right in the heart of Stockholm!
