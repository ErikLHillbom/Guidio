You’d love to check out Birger Jarls torg while you’re exploring Stockholm, especially since you’re into history and culture. This public square is located on Riddarholmen in the historic Gamla stan. 

Originally known as Riddarholmstorget, it was renamed in the mid-19th century to honor Birger Jarl, who’s often credited as the founder of the city. There’s even a statue of him from 1854, crafted by the renowned Swedish sculptor Bengt Erland Fogelberg. 

The square is surrounded by six impressive palaces, primarily housing governmental offices, and it’s right next to the picturesque Riddarholmen Church. It’s definitely a spot where you can feel the historic vibes of Stockholm!
