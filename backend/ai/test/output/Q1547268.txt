You know, Jon, the House of Nobility, or Riddarhuset, is quite a fascinating spot in Stockholm. It's not just a beautiful building; it also serves as a corporation that represents the Swedish nobility. The name actually translates to "House of Knights," reflecting its historical roots, which go back to the Middle Ages when Sweden only had one knight, Sten Sture.

This place has a rich history; from the 17th to the 19th century, it was part of the Riksdag, the Swedish parliament. It even hosted public concerts in the 18th century, showcasing talented artists of the time. Since 2003, it has shifted to a private institution focused on preserving noble traditions and culture.

Architecturally, it’s quite impressive, designed by Simon de la Vallée and completed by his son in the 17th century. If you take a closer look, you'll find a statue of Gustav Vasa at the south end and a lovely park with a statue of Axel Oxenstierna just north of the building. There’s a lot more history to explore here, which I think aligns perfectly with your interests!
