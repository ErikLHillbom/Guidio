You’re in for a treat if you visit the Lady Hutton, Jon! This former luxury yacht, built in 1924, has quite an intriguing history. Originally named Vanadis, she was the largest of her time and was originally designed for a wealthy owner before becoming a gift to the famous Woolworth heiress, Barbara Hutton, on her 18th birthday.

Now, this beautiful vessel has been transformed into a hotel and restaurant anchored at Riddarholmen since 1982. It still carries a sense of luxury, despite the cozy size of its 59 rooms. You’ll find the lounge has a glass floor, allowing guests to peek into the engine room below, which is a fun touch!

Interestingly, the yacht has undergone several name changes throughout its journey, with Lady Hutton being its most recent. Dining here is quite an experience as well, although it does come with a gourmet price tag. If you're into history and culture, this spot definitely offers a unique glimpse into maritime elegance and the fascinating life of its namesake.
