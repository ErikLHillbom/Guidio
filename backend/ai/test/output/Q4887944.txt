Oh, you’re going to love exploring Benickebrinken, Jon! These charming sloping streets in Gamla stan are steeped in history. They run from Österlånggatan up to Svartmangatan, and their names come from a tavern owner, Jören Benick, who had a popular spot called “Solen” or “The Sun.” 

Originally known as Svartbrödrabrinken and Svartmunkabrinken, these slopes were named after a monastery that once stood nearby, dating back to the 14th century. You can even find remnants like an old cellar from that time beneath one of the buildings! 

The area really transformed in the early 17th century when the city needed more taverns to accommodate foreign guests. It’s fascinating to think about how these streets have evolved over the centuries, from sleepy slopes to a bustling part of Stockholm's cultural tapestry. 

It’s a great spot to soak in the historical vibe while wandering through the quaint streets!
