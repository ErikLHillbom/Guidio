Have you heard of Kornhamnstorg, Jon? This public square is nestled right in Gamla stan, the historic heart of Stockholm. Its name translates to "Grain Harbour Square," and it has quite the historical legacy, with roots tracing back to the 15th century when it was known as Kornhaffn.

One of the standout features here is the statue of a man drawing a bow, often mistaken for William Tell, but it actually pays tribute to Engelbrekt Engelbrektsson, a leader of a significant rebellion in the 15th century. The square has witnessed a lot over the years, from being a bustling harbor where corn was once shipped to modern-day gatherings.

Exploring its surroundings, you’ll find it connected to several charming streets like Munkbroleden and Lilla Nygatan. If you enjoy history and culture as much as I think you do, this spot is definitely worth a visit!
