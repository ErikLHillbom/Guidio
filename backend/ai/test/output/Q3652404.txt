Högvaktsterrassen is a fascinating spot in Gamla stan, right in the heart of Stockholm. It runs alongside the outer court of the Royal Palace and offers a beautiful terrace with panoramic views of the Riksdag Building and Mynttorget square. You’ll find it starting from the Stockholm Cathedral, which adds to its charm.

The area has a rich history, once known as "Helvetet" or "Hell," which seems to have reflected local folklore and the darker aspects of its past. Can you believe that this was once the location for the city's executioner? Over the centuries, it evolved from being filled with craftsmen's workshops to housing significant buildings like the Oxenstierna Palace, designed in the 17th century.

Walking down Högvaktsterrassen, you’ll not only enjoy the views but also feel the weight of history around you. It’s definitely a place where the past comes alive!
