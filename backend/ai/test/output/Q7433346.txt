You’ll definitely want to check out Schönfeldts Gränd while you’re in Gamla stan, Jon. It’s this charming alley that stretches from Stora Nygatan down to Mälartorget. What makes it particularly interesting is its historical significance. The alley is named after Greger von Schönfeldt, a judge who owned a palace nearby back in the 17th century.

Originally, parts of this alley had different names—like Prechtens gränd, named after a court sculptor who had a workshop here. The mix of German and Swedish influences really highlights the rich cultural tapestry of Stockholm's old town. 

As you stroll through, you'll notice how it connects with other quaint streets like Lilla Nygatan and Munkbrogatan. Exploring Schönfeldts Gränd offers a glimpse into the city’s past and its architectural evolution, which I think you’d appreciate given your interest in history and culture!
