You’re in for a treat exploring Finska Kyrkogränd, Jon! This charming blind alley in Gamla stan offers a peek into Stockholm's history and culture. It runs south from Slottsbacken, nestled between the Finnish Church and the Tessin Palace. 

The alley has an interesting backstory. Originally part of the Crown's property, it led to Trädgårdsgatan and was excluded from a land donation meant for a ball game venue, which eventually became the Finnish Church in 1725. Over time, it transformed into a secluded space, sometimes even completely sealed off. 

So, while you stroll through, take a moment to soak in the unique atmosphere that this historic spot offers. It’s a lovely slice of Stockholm’s rich past!
