You’d really enjoy visiting the Swedish Centre for Architecture and Design, or ArkDes, Jon. This national museum, located on Skeppsholmen island, dives deep into Sweden’s architectural history and design culture. It showcases a range of exhibits focused on urban planning and contemporary design, all under the guidance of its acting director, Karin Nilsson.

The museum was initially founded in 1962 and has since evolved significantly. The current building, designed by the renowned architect Rafael Moneo, opened in 1998 and is a stunning blend of historical and modern styles. While it’s currently closed for renovations, it’s set to reopen in September 2024 with exciting new exhibition spaces.

ArkDes not only displays permanent collections reflecting Swedish architecture through the ages, but it also hosts thematic temporary exhibitions that explore contemporary issues in design. So, if you’re into history and culture, this place is sure to inspire and inform you! Keep it in mind for your visit to Stockholm!
