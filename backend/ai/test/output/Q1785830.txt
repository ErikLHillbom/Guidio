Oh, you’re going to find Skeppsholmen Church quite fascinating, Jon! Built between 1823 and 1849, this former church was designed as a neoclassical octagonal temple, inspired by the Pantheon in Rome. It replaced an earlier wooden church that was lost in a fire in 1822, and King Charles XIV John himself inaugurated it back in 1842.

The architecture is stunning, with its plain white walls and beautiful coffered ceiling. Inside, you'll see a unique wooden double cupola supported by elegant Doric columns and arches. After the church was secularized in 2002, it was transformed into a concert hall known as Eric Ericsonhallen, honoring a famous Swedish conductor. It's a beautiful blend of history and culture right here in central Stockholm!
