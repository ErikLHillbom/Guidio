Have you ever heard of the Royal Dramatic Theatre, Jon? It's Sweden's national stage for spoken drama, founded way back in 1788. This historical gem is located at Nybroplan in Stockholm, in a stunning Art Nouveau building that opened in 1908.

The theatre puts on around a thousand shows annually across five stages, so there's always something happening. Its rich history includes the involvement of notable artists like Carl Milles and Carl Larsson in its decorations, along with contributions from Prince Eugen. The Royal Dramatic Theatre has also been a launching pad for many famous actors and directors, including Greta Garbo and Ingrid Bergman, thanks to its acting school.

If you're into history and culture, visiting this iconic venue could be a real treat! It’s not just about the performances; it’s steeped in the evolution of Swedish drama and arts.
