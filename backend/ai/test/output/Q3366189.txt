You know, Jon, if you're looking for a unique place to stay in Stockholm, you should definitely consider Hotel Rival. Founded by Benny Andersson from ABBA, this hotel opened its doors on September 1, 2003, right at Mariatorget in Södermalm. 

What's fascinating is that it used to be the Hotel Aston and also housed a cinema that dates back to 1937. The cinema was quite significant, serving as a gathering spot for Finnish partisans during the war. Oh, and did you know that the Swedish premiere of "Mamma Mia!" was held right there? All the ABBA members were in attendance!

Hotel Rival has earned the title of Sweden's first boutique hotel and is known for its trendy vibe. The décor is a mix of modern minimalism and Scandi chic, featuring unique art and stylish furnishings—definitely a feast for the eyes. With 99 rooms, it also boasts a cocktail bar, a café, and live music at Watson’s Bar. It’s a great spot to soak in some history and culture while enjoying a comfortable stay!
