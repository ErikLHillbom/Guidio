You’ll definitely find the Church of Saint Mary Magdalene fascinating, Jon. Located in Södermalm, it’s dedicated to Mary Magdalene and has a rich history dating back to the 1350s. Originally built as a funeral chapel by King Magnus Eriksson, the church saw a lot of action during the Protestant Reformation when Gustav Vasa’s forces camped there.

The Baroque style is striking, especially the pulpit designed by Carl Johan Cronstedt, which features a medallion of Mary Magdalene herself. The high altar boasts an enchanting painting called the “Adoration of the Shepherds” from around 1800. You might also appreciate the fact that many notable figures, including the poet Evert Taube, are buried here.

With its unique architectural features and deep historical roots, it's a gem that reflects Stockholm’s story. Let me know if you want to explore it further!
