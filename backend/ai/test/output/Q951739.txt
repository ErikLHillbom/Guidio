You're in for a thrill-seeking treat at Gröna Lund with Insane! This Intamin Zac-Spin roller coaster opened in 2009 and really amps up the excitement with its unique design. The train cars are set up with four seats—two on each side—allowing you to spin and flip as you navigate the course. It creates a wild experience that’s pretty unforgettable.

Gröna Lund, rich in history and culture, has been a staple of Stockholm since 1883, so riding Insane not only gives you a rush but also connects you to the park's long-standing tradition of entertainment. If you're feeling adventurous, Jon, this roller coaster is a must-try!
