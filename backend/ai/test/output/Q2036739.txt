You’ll definitely want to check out Hedvig Eleonora Church while you're in Stockholm, Jon. Located in the charming Östermalm district, this beautiful octagonal church has been a part of the city’s landscape since it was consecrated in 1737. It's named after Queen Hedvig Eleonora, the wife of King Charles X.

What makes it particularly interesting is its role as one of the city's most popular venues for weddings, christenings, and funerals. Plus, the church features a stunning 24-bell carillon added in 1968, which adds a lovely musical touch to the atmosphere. Notable figures, including the famous DJ Avicii and singer Lasse Berghagen, are also laid to rest here, giving it a rich cultural connection.
