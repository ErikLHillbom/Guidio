If you're into history and culture, Jon, you should definitely check out the Regalia of Sweden, which are housed in the Royal Treasury beneath the Royal Palace in Stockholm. It's fascinating how these crowns and coronets haven't been worn since 1907 but are still featured in significant royal ceremonies like weddings and christenings. 

One of the most intriguing pieces is the Crown of Eric XIV, crafted in 1561. It’s a stunning example of Renaissance jewelry, featuring intricate designs that have changed over the years but still retain their original elegance. And then there's the unique orb created for Eric, engraved with a map of the world as it was known back then—how cool is that? 

Visiting the vaults offers a glimpse into Sweden's royal history, showcasing items like the sword of Gustav Vasa and various coronets used by the royal family. It’s a treasure trove for anyone intrigued by the royal legacy.
