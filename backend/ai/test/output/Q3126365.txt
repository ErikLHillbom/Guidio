Oh, you’ll love hearing about Hamburger Börs! It's this iconic venue in Stockholm, right on Jakobsgatan, known for its vibrant bar shows, or "krogshower." Over the years, it has hosted some of Sweden's biggest musical legends like Lill Lindfors and Monica Zetterlund. But it doesn’t stop there! International stars like Frank Sinatra and Johnny Cash have graced the stage too. 

Since the early 2000s, it’s also been home to a popular satire show called Roligt Elakt Aktuellt. If you’re into history and culture, Jon, this place is a treasure trove of musical heritage!
