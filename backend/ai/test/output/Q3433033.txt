You know, Jon, Mynttorget is quite a fascinating spot in Gamla stan, right in the heart of Stockholm. This public square, which translates to "the Coin Square," was named for its historical connection to the royal mint that once operated nearby from 1696 to 1850. 

What’s interesting is that it's not just a pretty place; it has a significant political history too. Being situated close to the Parliament and the Royal Palace, it often serves as a gathering spot for political demonstrations. Greta Thunberg famously held her climate strikes there, highlighting its role in modern activism.

The square is surrounded by some notable structures, including the oldest insurance company in Sweden, dating back to 1746, which gives it a rich cultural backdrop. So, if you’re keen on history and culture, Mynttorget definitely deserves a visit!
