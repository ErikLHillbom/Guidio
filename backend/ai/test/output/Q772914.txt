You’ll really enjoy exploring Wrangel Palace, Jon. This townhouse mansion is nestled on Riddarholmen islet in the heart of Gamla Stan, Stockholm's old town. Its history is quite fascinating—originally part of Gustav Vasa's defense fortifications in the 1530s, it transformed into a palace around 1630.

The building underwent significant renovations in the 17th century, particularly under architect Nicodemus Tessin the Elder for Count Carl Gustaf Wrangel. After a major fire in 1697, it became a royal residence, serving as the official home for the royal family until the Royal Palace was completed in 1754. 

It’s interesting to note that Wrangel Palace also housed the Svea Court of Appeal since 1756. So, if you're into history and culture, this place is definitely worth checking out!
