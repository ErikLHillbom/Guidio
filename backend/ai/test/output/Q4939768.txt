You’re going to love hearing about Bollhuset, Jon! It’s actually the first theater in Stockholm and the very first real theater building in Scandinavia, dating back to 1627. Originally, it was built for ball sports, like the aristocratic jeu de paume, and it had a solid run in that capacity for about forty years.

Later on, from 1667 until 1792, Bollhuset transitioned into a vibrant theater hub. It was the home to Sweden’s first national theater and even hosted the Royal Swedish Opera and Ballet for a time. Imagine all the history that unfolded within those walls!

Located near the Royal Palace, it was a large, simple structure, but its significance in Swedish theater history is monumental. Even after it was torn down in 1793, it left a lasting legacy, paving the way for future theatrical developments in Sweden.

So, Jon, if you’re into history and culture, Bollhuset is a fascinating spot that really shaped the landscape of performing arts in Sweden. How cool is that?
