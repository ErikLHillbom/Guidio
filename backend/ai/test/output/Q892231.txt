You know, Jon, the Bonde Palace is quite a fascinating spot in Gamla stan, right in the heart of Stockholm. It was originally built between 1662 and 1667 for Gustaf Bonde, who was the Lord High Treasurer back in the day. The design is a lovely mix of French Baroque and Renaissance styles, which gives it a unique charm.

This palace has been through a lot. After the Royal Palace burned down in 1697, it hosted significant institutions like the Royal Library and the Svea Court of Appeal. It’s also witnessed some dramatic moments in Swedish history, including the public flogging of a controversial figure in 1792.

Interestingly, it transitioned from a private residence to a municipal building, and since 1949, it has housed the Swedish Supreme Court. The restoration efforts have kept its historical essence intact, making it a valuable piece of Sweden’s architectural history. If you're keen on history and culture, this place is a must-see!
