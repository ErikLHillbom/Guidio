You know, Jon, the Great Synagogue of Stockholm is quite a remarkable place. Nestled near Kungsträdgården, this synagogue was completed in 1870 and designed by architect Fredrik Wilhelm Scholander in the Moorish Revival style. It's not just a beautiful building; it represents a significant part of the city's history and Jewish community.

The synagogue features intricate decorative inscriptions in Hebrew, including an inviting message from Exodus that translates to "And make Me a sanctuary that I may dwell among them." It’s a lovely touch that adds to the atmosphere. 

Beneath the synagogue, you'll find the Judiska biblioteket, which houses a multilingual collection of books and occasionally hosts exhibits related to Jewish history, like the one on the Friedrich Kellner World War II diary. 

There's even a monument dedicated to Holocaust victims, making it a place of remembrance and reflection. And fun fact: in 2015, Ute Steyer became Sweden's first female rabbi here! It’s a profound spot to explore if you’re interested in history and culture.
