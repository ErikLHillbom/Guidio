You’re going to love exploring Riddarholmen, Jon! This small islet is steeped in history and is right in the heart of Stockholm's old town, Gamla Stan. The main highlight is definitely the Riddarholmskyrkan, the royal burial church where many Swedish monarchs are laid to rest.

As you stroll around, you’ll notice the charming 17th-century palaces that give the island its aristocratic vibe. It's fascinating to think that the island was once a bustling noble retreat, with impressive structures like Wrangel Palace featuring a medieval tower and stunning architecture designed by Nicodemus Tessin the Elder.

Don’t miss the panoramic views of Riddarfjärden from the western end of the island, which are perfect for a photo op. The statue of Birger Jarl, often hailed as the founder of Stockholm, adds a nice historical touch. It’s a spot where history and culture really come alive, and I think you’ll find it quite captivating!
