You know, Jon, the Marcus and Amalia Wallenberg Foundation has quite an interesting history. Established in 1960 with a donation of SEK 442,000 from banker Jacob Wallenberg, it has grown significantly over the years. In 2018 alone, the foundation granted a remarkable SEK 103 million to various programs, totaling nearly SEK 2.6 billion since its inception.

It primarily focuses on funding high-potential research projects, especially in the humanities and social sciences, and supports initiatives aimed at children and youth through reputable organizations. One notable project is the WASP-HS program, which explores the social implications of AI and autonomous systems, blending technology with humanities research.

It's fascinating to think about how the Wallenberg family has established numerous foundations, with this one being the third-largest among them, collectively awarding around SEK 2.2 billion each year. Quite a legacy, wouldn’t you say?
