Bollhustäppan is a charming little public space tucked away in Gamla stan, the historic heart of Stockholm. Named after the nearby Bollhuset theatre, it’s quite a fascinating spot, Jon. While it may seem small, its history is rich, dating back to significant medieval charitable institutions and ball game buildings from the 17th century.

One of the highlights you won’t want to miss is the tiny sculpture called "Pojke som tittar på månen," or "Boy Looking at the Moon." This delightful piece captures a nostalgic moment from the artist's childhood. Locals and tourists alike enjoy interacting with it, often leaving coins and even dressing the sculpture for the seasons! 

Restored in 2002, Bollhustäppan now features inviting benches and improved accessibility, making it a great little spot to soak in some culture and history while enjoying the ambiance of the old town.
