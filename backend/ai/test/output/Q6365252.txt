You’ll love checking out Kanslikajen when you're wandering around Gamla stan, Jon. This charming quay, which translates to "Chancellery Quay," stretches along the southern shore of the Stallkanalen canal. It leads from Stallbron and Mynttorget to Vasabron, making it a picturesque spot to enjoy views of the water.

The name was established in the 1920s, and it has historical significance, too. Nearby, you'll find remnants of a 19th-century prison that once housed inmates in individual cells—a practice that faded away by the 1940s. Plus, thanks to the Projekt Nattljus initiative a few years ago, the area is beautifully illuminated at night. It's a lovely blend of history and modernity, perfect for someone like you who appreciates culture!
