So, Jon, if you're wandering through Gamla Stan, you might come across Staffan Sasses Gränd—it's a quaint little blind alley that stretches north from Köpmangatan. This spot is rich in history! 

It’s named after Staffan Sasse, a prominent figure back in the early 16th century who played a role in Swedish politics during some tumultuous times. He bought a house along Köpmangatan in 1524, and the alley has been linked to his name since 1569. 

Interestingly, this alley has had several names over the years, such as being referred to as the alley of Blasius Dundie, a Scottish merchant who had quite a business presence in Stockholm. By the end of the 17th century, it was even known as Jgnatij grendh, named after a printer who had a workshop there. 

In 1925, they decided to go back to the original name, which is what you see today. It’s a charming piece of history in the heart of Stockholm, and definitely worth a stroll if you enjoy exploring historical places!
