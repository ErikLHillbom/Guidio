It's fascinating to think about the 1912 Summer Olympics in Stockholm, especially regarding cycling. On July 7th, only one event took place: a time trial that also served as an individual race. What makes that year particularly unique, Jon, is that it was the only time in Olympic history without any track cycling events being held. 

A total of 123 cyclists from sixteen nations participated, showcasing a blend of competitive spirit and international camaraderie. This moment in Olympic history certainly adds an interesting layer to the cultural tapestry of early 20th-century sports!
