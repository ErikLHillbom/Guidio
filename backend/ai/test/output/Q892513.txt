You’ll definitely want to check out the Hötorget buildings while you’re exploring Stockholm, Jon. These five high-rise office buildings, standing at 72 meters tall, are quite the iconic sight in the city center. Built between 1952 and 1966, they’re referred to as “scrapers” rather than skyscrapers, giving a unique twist to the skyline.

What’s fascinating is that each building was designed by different architects, resulting in a slight variation in their façades. They were inspired by modern architectural trends from places like New York City. Originally, there were plans for pedestrian bridges connecting various shops and malls below the buildings, but after some social challenges in the ‘70s, most of that vision changed.

The history behind these structures is quite rich, reflecting a dream of a clean, modern city that aligns with utopian ideals of urban design. So, if you have a moment, make sure to take a closer look at these architectural gems—they're not just buildings; they’re a snapshot of Stockholm’s cultural evolution!
