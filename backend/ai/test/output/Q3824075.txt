You know, Jon, the men's individual time trial at the 1912 Summer Olympics was quite a fascinating event in the history of cycling. It marked the first time this particular race was included in the Olympics. Held on July 7, 1912, it took place on a grueling 320-kilometer course that started at 2:00 a.m. 

The route, which had been utilized for the Mälaren runt race since 1901, meandered through several towns, with intermediate checkpoints at places like Eskilstuna and Västerås. Can you imagine the determination it took for those 123 cyclists from 16 nations to compete in such conditions? The finish line was right in the Olympic Stadium, making for a dramatic conclusion to a long night of racing. It's a great example of how deeply embedded cycling is in the culture of Sweden!
