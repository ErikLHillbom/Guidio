Oh, Hötorget metro station is quite an interesting spot, especially if you appreciate history and culture, Jon! It’s located in the heart of Norrmalm and serves as a key stop on the Green line of Stockholm’s metro. This station originally opened back in 1952 as Kungsgatan, but it got its current name when the line was extended in 1957.

One of the cool things about Hötorget is that it features the original 1950s signage and decor, giving you a real sense of its history. Plus, as part of the city's "Art in the Stockholm metro" initiative, the platform has these striking white neon strips added in 1998, which really light up the space. 

If you decide to explore, you’ll find an underground square with some shops at the central entrance, making it a lively spot to check out. It's also conveniently located near Hötorget square, so you can easily access other parts of the city from there!
