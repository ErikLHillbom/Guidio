You know, Jon, the Lillienhoff Palace has quite the history nestled right by Medborgarplatsen in Stockholm. Built between 1668 and 1670 by Joachim Pötter, a prominent merchant and shipowner, it reflects Dutch baroque architecture, which was quite the trend in the mid-17th century here. 

What’s fascinating is that it originally served as an embassy for Great Britain before becoming a poor house and later a city property. You can still catch a bit of that history today, as the palace houses a popular restaurant called Snaps and even some residential apartments. It's definitely a blend of history and modern culture, making it a unique spot to visit!
