You know, Jon, if you're wandering around Gamla stan, you might want to check out Fisketorget, or Fishermen's Square. This historical public square has a fascinating past that dates back to the 14th century. It was originally known as Fiskestrand, which means 'Fishery Shore.' Can you imagine the bustling market scene back then? 

As Stockholm grew, the area became more developed, and by 1413, it even had defensive towers and a blacksmith's shop, which was quite a big deal at the time. It's cool to think about how this spot has evolved. The well that was once here even gave its name to one of the alleys!

Fisketorget is a great spot to soak in some history while you're exploring the charming old town. You’ll definitely feel the cultural vibe of Stockholm in this area!
