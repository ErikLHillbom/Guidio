You know, Jon, Bofills Båge is quite a fascinating spot in Södermalm. This residential complex, designed by the renowned Spanish architect Ricardo Bofill, was built between 1991 and 1992. What’s really interesting is the building’s crescent shape, which spans a diameter of 180 meters and houses around 300 apartments, along with shops and offices.

It's a part of a significant urban redevelopment project that transformed an old railyard into a vibrant city block. The design reflects traditional Nordic architecture, emphasizing simple, pure lines, which gives it a unique charm. Plus, it’s flanked by Söder Torn, adding to the architectural diversity of the area. If you appreciate history and culture, this is definitely a spot worth checking out!
