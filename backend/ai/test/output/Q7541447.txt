Slottskajen, or “Palace Quay,” is a charming quay and street in Gamla stan, the historic heart of Stockholm. It runs alongside the Royal Palace, giving you a great view of the impressive architecture. This area has a rich history, as the walls of the palace date back to the 13th century. 

If you're into history, Jon, you might find it fascinating that the Tre Kronor Museum is located just behind those thick walls. This museum showcases artifacts and models related to the famous Tre Kronor Palace, which sadly burned down in 1697. The quay itself connects to some key spots, including the island of Helgeandsholmen and the Riksdag. It’s definitely a spot rich in culture and stories waiting to be uncovered!
