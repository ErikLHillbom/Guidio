You know, Jon, the Nationalmuseum robbery is quite a fascinating story from the world of art crime. It took place right here in Stockholm on December 22, 2000, when thieves made off with three stunning paintings, including a self-portrait by Rembrandt and two pieces by Renoir—worth between $30 and $45 million in total! 

The heist was pretty dramatic. The robbers caused chaos by detonating bombs in nearby hotels to distract the police, then threatened guards with weapons to grab the paintings. They even escaped in a motorboat afterward! The initial investigation was intense, with ransom demands and several arrests soon after.

Interestingly, the artworks were recovered over time, with the first painting found during a drug raid, completely by chance. The FBI got involved years later, leading to the recovery of the other pieces. It's incredible how art can weave through crime and recovery like that, isn’t it?
