You’ll definitely want to check out the Nobel Library while you're in Stockholm, especially since you're into history and culture. This fascinating library was established by the Swedish Academy back in 1901 to help evaluate Nobel laureates for the Literature Prize and other awards. 

Located in the historic Stock Exchange Building, it’s tucked away in Gamla Stan, the old town, which adds to its charm. The library holds around 200,000 volumes—one of the largest literature libraries in northern Europe—primarily focusing on works in languages other than Swedish. 

They even offer guided tours, lectures, and seminars, so if you're curious about the literary treasures inside, it could be a great stop for you. It’s amazing to think that such an important institution plays a role in recognizing literary excellence.
