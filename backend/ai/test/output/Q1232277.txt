You’re in for a treat with Djurgårdsbron, Jon! This bridge, designed by Carl Fraenell and completed for the Stockholm World's Fair in 1897, connects Östermalm to the charming island of Djurgården. It has a rich history, with the original bridge on this spot appearing as far back as 1696. 

What makes it truly special are the stunning sculptures of Old Norse gods gracing the bridge. You’ll find Heimdall, Odin’s wife Frigg, Freyja, and Thor, all crafted by artist Rold Adlersparre. Plus, the decorative railings and candelabras add to the bridge’s cultural charm. 

If you appreciate history and culture, this spot is definitely a must-see while you're in Stockholm!
