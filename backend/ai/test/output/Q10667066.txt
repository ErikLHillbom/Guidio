The Sheraton Stockholm Hotel is quite a notable spot, Jon. Located right at the intersection of Vasagatan and Tegelbacken, it opened in 1971 and was actually the first Sheraton hotel in Continental Europe! With its 465 rooms, it's one of the largest hotels in Sweden, making it a significant part of the city's landscape.

The building, designed by AOS Arkitekter, has a reddish-brown facade that's quite striking, and it holds a high cultural historical value. Interestingly, the interior was renovated in 2007, but the hotel's architecture still reflects its rich history. It’s definitely worth checking out if you're interested in the cultural evolution of Stockholm!
