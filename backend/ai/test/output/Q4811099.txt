Astoria was quite the landmark in Stockholm, located on Nybrogatan in the Östermalm district. This cinema opened its doors back in 1928 and was one of the last single-screen theaters in the city when it ultimately closed. 

Jon, it was known for hosting film premieres and had a rich history tied to the film director Anders Sandrew, who played a key role in its establishment. The cinema was beautifully designed, boasting a stage for live performances and even space for an orchestra during the silent film era.

Over the years, it underwent several renovations but maintained its charm with lavish décor. It's interesting to note that discussions around its demolition sparked political debates in Stockholm. It’s a fascinating piece of the city’s cultural history that resonates with many who appreciate the arts!
