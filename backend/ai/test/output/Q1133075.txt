Storkyrkan is such a fascinating spot, Jon! It’s the oldest church in Stockholm, dating back to the early 13th century, and is located right in the heart of Gamla stan, nestled between the Royal Palace and the main square, Stortorget. 

Originally consecrated to Saint Nicholas in 1306, the church has a stunning blend of architectural styles. Inside, you can admire its late medieval hall design, complete with vaulted ceilings and brick pillars, while the exterior showcases a Baroque look thanks to extensive renovations in the 18th century.

The church played a pivotal role during the Reformation, being the first place in Sweden where Mass was celebrated in Swedish. Over the centuries, it has hosted royal weddings, like that of Crown Princess Victoria in 2010, and important funerals, including those of famous figures like Astrid Lindgren.

You’ll also find significant artworks inside, like the impressive statue of Saint George and the Dragon, a remarkable medieval piece. Plus, there’s the Vädersolstavlan, the oldest color depiction of Stockholm. All in all, Storkyrkan is not just a church; it’s a living piece of Swedish history and culture. What do you think?
