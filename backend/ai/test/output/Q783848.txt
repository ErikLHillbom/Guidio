Right near the Royal Palace, you’ll find the Tessin Palace, a stunning example of Baroque architecture in Gamla stan, Stockholm's historic old town. This town house was built between 1694 and 1700 by the renowned architect Nicodemus Tessin the Younger. It’s fascinating to think that it was later owned by his son, Carl Gustaf Tessin, who had to sell it due to financial troubles in 1755. 

Over the years, the palace became a property of the crown and served as a residence for the Governor of Stockholm. It’s definitely a spot where history and culture intertwine beautifully. If you’re wandering around the area, it's worth a look, Jon!
