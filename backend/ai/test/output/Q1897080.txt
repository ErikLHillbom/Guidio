Have you heard of Mariatorget, Jon? It's a charming square and park located in Södermalm, right here in Stockholm. Constructed in the late 1760s, it was originally named Adolf Fredriks torg after King Adolphus Frederick, but it was renamed Mariatorget in 1959 to avoid confusion with a nearby church. The name now reflects the nearby Maria Magdalena kyrka.

One of the highlights of the square is a beautiful fountain topped with a sculpture of Thor, inspired by the Norse mythology. You can also spot a bust of Emanuel Swedenborg in the corner, which adds to the area's cultural richness. 

Surrounding the park, you'll find plenty of cafés and bars, making it a lively part of the city, especially known for its vibrant LGBT+ nightlife. It's a great spot to soak in some local history and culture, just a stone's throw away!
