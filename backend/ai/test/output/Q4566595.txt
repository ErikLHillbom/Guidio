You’ll find Baggensgatan nestled in Gamla stan, the heart of Stockholm. This charming street runs as a southern extension of Bollhusgränd and leads down to Svartmangatan. It's interesting to note that it was named after Admiral Jakob Bagge, who received a lot here from King Gustav Vasa back in 1536. 

Historically, Baggensgatan was strategically positioned just inside the eastern city wall, making it a key thoroughfare. If you’re into quirky historical tidbits, the street was once home to the opera diva Elisabeth Olin, who took the stage at the inauguration of the royal opera back in 1773. 

And if you enjoy a bit of cultural flair, the troubadour Carl Michael Bellman even dedicated a song to this street, painting a lively picture of its past. Walking down Baggensgatan, you can almost feel the echoes of its vibrant history, Jon!
