You’ll love exploring Drakens Gränd, Jon. This charming alley in Gamla stan is steeped in history and stretches from Skeppsbron to Österlånggatan, running parallel to other quaint streets like Stora Hoparegränd. 

The name “Drakens Gränd” comes from a tavern called Draken, or "The Dragon," that used to be located at the western end. It had quite a history of ownership in the 17th century, and it was known as the Förgyllda Draken later on. 

So as you stroll through, you’re walking in the footsteps of history, taking in the culture of old Stockholm. Who knows what stories those cobblestones could tell!
