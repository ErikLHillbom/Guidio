You know, Jon, the Old Parliament House is quite a fascinating spot in Stockholm. It's located right on Riddarholmen island at Birger Jarls torg. This building served as the seat of the Swedish Parliament from 1833 until 1905, which is pretty significant in terms of history.

After 1905, it transitioned to housing the Administrative Court of Appeal, but the architecture itself remains a major draw. There's a lovely seaside section added in 1911 that showcases the National Romantic style, which you might find interesting. If you enjoy diving into history and culture, this place is definitely worth a visit!
