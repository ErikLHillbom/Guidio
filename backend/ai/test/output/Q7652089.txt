You’re going to love exploring Sven Vintappares Gränd, Jon! This quaint alley in Gamla stan has a rich history that dates back to 1588. It’s named after Sven Staffansson, who was known as a wine-tapper for the king. Imagine strolling through a place that once had a residence of a royal servant!

As you walk, you’ll notice it runs parallel to some other charming alleys, and it leads you past a small square called Sven Vintappares Torg. The poetic legacy of this alley is interesting too; it was mentioned by writer Anna Maria Lenngren, and there’s a song by Evert Taube that references a woman who lived here. 

It’s a perfect spot to soak in the historical atmosphere of the old town, and I think you’ll find it quite enchanting!
