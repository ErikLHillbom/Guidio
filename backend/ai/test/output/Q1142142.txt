You know, Jon, if you're interested in diving into Sweden's rich cultural history, the Nordic Museum is a fantastic spot to check out while you're in Stockholm. Located on Djurgården, this impressive museum showcases Sweden's ethnography from the early modern period all the way to today.

Founded in the late 19th century by Artur Hazelius, who also started the open-air museum Skansen, it has a fascinating backstory. Originally called the Scandinavian Ethnographic Collection, it has grown to house over 1.5 million objects, including artifacts from peasant culture as well as items reflecting urban lifestyles.

The building itself is a sight to behold, completed in 1907 and designed in a style influenced by Danish Renaissance architecture. You’ll definitely want to check out the enormous main hall, which features a striking sculpture of King Gustav Vasa. It's quite a monumental space!

With its intriguing collections and exhibits, the Nordic Museum offers a deep dive into Swedish history and culture that I think you'll really appreciate.
