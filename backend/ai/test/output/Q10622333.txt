Ah, Pelikansgränd is a charming little alley in Gamla stan, the historic heart of Stockholm. Connecting Gaffelgränd to Österlånggatan, this narrow passage has a fascinating history. It was known as Lilla S:t Johannes gränd back in 1664 and later adopted the name Pelikansgränd due to an inn called Pelikan that stood nearby.

What’s particularly interesting, Jon, is how the alley was built on a landfill, with archaeological finds revealing that the area has been slowly sinking over the centuries. You can actually see the unique leaning poles from the 15th century, which show just how much the land has changed over time.

If you enjoy history and culture, wandering through Pelikansgränd is like stepping back in time. The architecture is quaint, and you might even spot some historical portals as you explore. It's definitely worth a visit when you're in the area!
