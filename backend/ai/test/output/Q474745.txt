You know, Jon, if you’re interested in some history and culture, the Djurgårdslinjen tram line is a fantastic piece of Stockholm's heritage. It runs between Norrmalmstorg and Waldemarsudde and is known for its vintage charm. 

Originally, this line operated like many others until it was shut down during the switch to right-hand traffic in 1967. Luckily, it was revived in 1991 thanks to the Swedish Tramway Society, and now it operates on a nonprofit basis. 

What’s really cool is that the trams you see on the line date back to as early as the 20th century. During the summer months, they even couple a “Rolling Café” for a unique experience! You can use all SL fares, too, which makes hopping on easy. It’s a lovely way to travel and soak in the city’s history. What do you think?
