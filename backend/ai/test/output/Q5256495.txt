You’ve got to check out Den gröne Jägaren while you’re in Södermalm, Jon. This charming bar and restaurant has a fascinating history that dates back to the 1600s, originally starting as a small tavern. It’s not just any place; this is where Jacob Johan Anckarström dined right before making a notorious decision that changed Swedish history! 

Located at Götgatan 64, the restaurant now sits in the lovely Hellgrenska Palace, which was built in 1866. You’ll spot the iconic façade featuring a green-clad hunter, a nod to its name meaning "The Green Hunter." The entire place was renovated in 2019, blending its rich past with modern touches. If you’re into history and culture, this spot is definitely worth a visit!
