The Stockholm Stock Exchange Building, or Börshuset, is a fascinating piece of history located right in Gamla Stan, the old town of Stockholm. Built between 1773 and 1778 by architect Erik Palmstedt, it was originally the home of the stock exchange until 1998. 

What’s really captivating, Jon, is that since 1914, the building has been the meeting place for the Swedish Academy. It’s here that they announce the Nobel Prize for Literature, which adds a layer of cultural significance. Plus, it houses the Nobel Museum and the Nobel Library, making it a hub for anyone interested in history and culture. The architecture itself, with its classical design, is also a treat for the eyes. If you get a chance, strolling around Stortorget square nearby is definitely worth it!
