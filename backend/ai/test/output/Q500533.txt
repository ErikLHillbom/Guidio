Have you heard about Järnpojke, Jon? It's this charming little sculpture known as the Iron Boy, tucked away in Gamla stan, Stockholm's Old Town. Created by artist Liss Eriksson in 1954 and unveiled in 1967, it stands at just 15 centimeters tall, making it the smallest public monument in the city.

What's really cool is that the boy is often dressed up for winter, sporting a hat and scarf! You’ll find him hidden behind the Finnish Church, which is just a short stroll from the grandeur of the Stockholm Palace. It's one of those delightful little surprises that add character to the city’s rich history and culture. Definitely worth a visit!
