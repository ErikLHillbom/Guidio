You've got to check out Sveriges Riksbank while you're in Stockholm, Jon. Established back in 1668, it holds the title of the world's oldest surviving central bank. Pretty impressive, right? Originally known as the Riksens Ständers Bank, it stepped in after the collapse of Stockholm Banco, and since then, it has played a crucial role in Sweden's monetary system.

The Riksbank is responsible for issuing banknotes and has been at the forefront of innovative monetary policies, like implementing negative interest rates. Plus, its motto, "Hinc robur et securitas," translates to "Herefore strength and security," reflecting its historical significance. 

And if you're into the Nobel Prizes, you'll find that the Riksbank even established the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel, awarded annually. So, it’s not just a bank; it’s a piece of living history in the heart of Sweden!
