If you're wandering through Gamla stan, make sure to check out Stenbastugränd. This charming little alley connects Västerlånggatan to Brantingtorget and has a rich history dating back to 1440. It was originally named after a stone sauna that used to be located here! 

Jon, it’s fascinating how the alley was also known as Wruaders gränd for a time, named after a local brewery owner. The name changed back to Stenbastugränd in 1925 to avoid confusion with another street. You’ll notice it’s quite short now, especially after some World War II renovations, but it still carries the weight of its history. It could be a lovely stop for some unique photos during your exploration!
