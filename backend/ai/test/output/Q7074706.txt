You know, Jon, if you're venturing around the Royal Palace, you definitely shouldn't miss the Obelisk at Slottsbacken. This impressive structure is not just a monument; it's considered the very heart of Stockholm. Unveiled back in 1800, it honors the brave citizens who supported the city during the Russo-Swedish War.

Interestingly, the original obelisk faced significant wear and tear over the years, leading to its dismantling in 2017. But don't worry, it was rebuilt with newly quarried granite and unveiled again in 2020. Standing at about 30 meters tall, it’s quite a sight. The neo-Egyptian design adds a unique charm, crafted by artist Louis Jean Desprez.

What’s more fascinating, Jon, is that all street numbers in Stockholm trace their origins back to this very spot. It's a perfect blend of history and culture, right in the heart of the city!
