You know, Jon, if you're wandering around central Stockholm, you should definitely check out Kastellholmsbron. It's this charming little bridge that connects Kastellholmen to Skeppsholmen. 

The bridge has a rich history; it was built back in the 1640s alongside the original citadel. While the citadel has seen a few changes over the years, with the current structure being rebuilt after an explosion in 1848, the bridge you see today dates to 1880. It’s a lovely spot to soak in some history and enjoy the views. Perfect for someone like you who's interested in culture!
