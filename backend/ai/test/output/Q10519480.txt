You’ll love exploring Helga Lekamens Gränd, Jon! This charming alley lies in Gamla stan, right in the heart of Stockholm. Connecting Västerlånggatan to Stora Nygatan, it's a historic spot with a fascinating past.

The name translates to "Alley of the Holy Body," dating back to the 14th century when it was associated with the Guild of the Holy Body of Christ, which was quite significant during the Middle Ages. In fact, it was the largest guild in Sweden, with royalty among its members! 

As you stroll through, you’ll feel the echoes of history, especially since the alley’s mentions date back to 1505. While it underwent name changes over the centuries, it was officially restored to its original name in 1922. It's a perfect blend of history and culture, making it a delightful stop on your journey through Stockholm.
