Strömparterren is a lovely park in central Stockholm, right on Helgeandsholmen. Built back in 1830, it offers a nice blend of history and culture that I think you'll appreciate, Jon. At one end of the park, you'll find the striking sculpture Solsångaren by Carl Milles, which honors the poet Esaias Tegnér and his poem "Song to the Sun." There's also a beautiful bronze piece called Dimman by Gusten Lindberg, adding another layer of artistic flair to the space. Plus, if you’re interested in more history, the Medieval Museum is just a short walk from there, tucked under Norrbro. It's a perfect spot to soak in some culture while enjoying the views!
