You’ll find Johannesgränd nestled in the heart of Gamla stan, connecting Skeppsbron to Österlånggatan. This charming little alley has quite a history, first noted in records back in 1503 as "sancte johannis grendt." It’s named after the church of the Order of Saint John, which stood nearby in the early 16th century. 

Interestingly, after the Reformation, that church was demolished, but excavations in the 1960s uncovered parts of its foundation along with a graveyard, giving us a glimpse into its past. It's fascinating to think about the stories this alley could tell, especially with its ties to the knightly order dating back to the 1330s. Exploring spots like this, Jon, really brings the rich history of Stockholm to life!
