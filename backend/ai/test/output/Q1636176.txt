You’re in for a treat, especially since you’re interested in history and culture! Just a short distance from where you are, the Royal Armoury, or Livrustkammaren, is the oldest museum in Sweden, established back in 1628 by King Gustavus Adolphus. He wanted to preserve his clothes from his campaign in Poland, which really kicked off this fascinating collection.

Inside, you’ll find a treasure trove of artifacts that tell the story of Swedish military history and royalty. For instance, there’s a unique drinking horn made from the last aurochs bull, a piece of war booty from the Swedish invasion of Poland. And if you’re into royal fashion, you can check out Queen Kristina's coronation robe and the wedding dress of queen Sophia Magdalena from 1766. It’s a blend of history that really showcases the richness of Sweden's past, which I think you’ll appreciate.
