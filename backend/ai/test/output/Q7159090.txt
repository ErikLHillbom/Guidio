You know, Jon, while you're exploring Gamla stan, you might want to check out Peder Fredags Gränd. It’s a charming little blind alley that stretches north from Köpmangatan, nestled between Skeppar Olofs Gränd and Staffan Sasses Gränd, just south of the Tessin Palace.

What’s fascinating is that this alley remained nameless until the 20th century! It actually appears on a map from 1700, but then was mysteriously left off another map in 1733. The name we use today was adopted in 1939, likely inspired by its connections to historical figures from the time of King Gustav Vasa.

Peder Fredag himself was a notable figure in the early 16th century who played a key role in resisting Danish forces. He was a burgher of Stockholm and famously opposed the terms of surrender to the Danes. He later became a captain under Gustav Vasa and even led successful defenses against attacks on the city. It's a little piece of history that adds character to the old town, perfect for someone like you who enjoys immersing in culture!
