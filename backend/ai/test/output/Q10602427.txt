You’ll definitely find Norra Dryckesgränd intriguing, especially given your interest in history and culture. This alley in Gamla stan, Stockholm’s old town, connects Skeppsbron to Järntorgsgatan. Its name translates to "Northern Drunkenness Alley," which hints at a colorful past.

Originally known as Cartusegrenden back in 1518, it was linked to the Carthusian Order, famous for their strict lifestyle and the renowned Chartreuse liqueur. Interestingly, King Gustav Vasa expelled them in the 1520s, which probably added to the alley's reputation over the years.

A little dark history even surrounds it—a homicide was reported there in 1622, hinting at perhaps a more rugged side to its character. The name itself may even come from a tavern keeper! So if you’re wandering through Gamla stan, Norra Dryckesgränd is a fascinating spot to check out.
