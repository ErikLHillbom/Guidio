You’ll love Riddarhustorget, especially if you’re into history and culture, Jon! This square in Gamla stan, right in front of the House of Knights, is steeped in Swedish heritage. It dates back to the 17th century and used to be the center of Swedish politics, showcasing the significance of the nobility in its time.

As you stroll around, you'll notice the beautiful architecture, with the House of Knights itself being a standout. Designed by notable architects, the building reflects the shift in power from nobility to a more liberal society. You'll also find the Bonde Palace nearby, which served as a city hall for some time and now houses the Supreme Court.

The square is not just a pretty sight; it’s a reminder of Sweden’s rich political past and its evolution over the centuries. Plus, the surrounding views, including the canals and bridges, add to the charm. It's a perfect spot to soak in some history while enjoying the scenery!
