You know, Jon, if you're interested in history, the Conquest of Stockholm is quite a significant event. It happened on June 17, 1523, during the Swedish War of Liberation. This battle marked the end of Danish control in Sweden, as Stockholm was the last stronghold they had in the country.

The siege had been going on for a while, and by this time, the defenders were really exhausted. They eventually sought safe passage and the ability to keep their equipment, which Gustav Vasa agreed to. It was a pivotal moment for Sweden, especially since just days before, he had been crowned king. Imagine the atmosphere in the city as he marched in on Midsummer's Eve! 

Also, if you’re into arts, the event has been immortalized in an opera, "Gustaf Wasa." It’s a fascinating piece that you might find interesting too!
