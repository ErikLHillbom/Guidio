You’re in luck, Jon! Slussen metro station is quite a fascinating spot in Stockholm. Located in the Södermalm district, it serves both the Red and Green lines of the metro. Originally opening in 1933 as an underground tram stop, it became a metro terminal in 1950 for the line heading south to Hökarängen. 

The station has undergone some significant changes over the years, including a major rebuild when the line was extended to Hötorget in 1957. One interesting tidbit is that Slussen has also been the terminus for the Saltsjöbanan railway since the 1940s, though that's been temporarily shifted due to reconstruction work.

There’s even a recent art exhibition that sparked a big debate about its content, which shows how the station is still part of cultural conversations today. So, while you’re in the area, it’s worth checking out the blend of history and contemporary culture that Slussen offers!
