You’ll definitely find Gamla Riksarkivet interesting, Jon! This historic building, located at Arkivgatan 3 on Riddarholmen, served as the Swedish National Archives until 1968. Its 19th-century Brick Romanesque architecture really captures the essence of the medieval history surrounding the area. 

What’s particularly striking is the grand central portion of the building, highlighted by large windows in the reading room, which offers a glimpse into its past as a public institution. Plus, it’s connected to the Stenbock Palace, where the archive began back in 1863. It’s a great spot to appreciate both history and culture in Stockholm!
