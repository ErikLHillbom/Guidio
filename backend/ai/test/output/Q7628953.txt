You know, Jon, if you're in Stockholm, you really should check out Sturehof. It's a legendary seafood and shellfish restaurant located right at Stureplan, and it has a fascinating history. 

It dates back to 1897, when Ernst Marcus opened a beer bar called Malta there. The establishment itself has been around since 1887, so it celebrated its 130th anniversary not too long ago! The name Sturehof came about in 1905, and it remained in the Marcus family until 1976. Now, it's part of a restaurant group that runs several places in the area.

What’s really cool is that Sturehof has always been known for its fish and shellfish, but it’s evolved over the years to have a fantastic wine list. Plus, some big names like Bill Clinton and John Bon Jovi have dined there!

And here’s a neat tidbit: it was at Sturehof that the idea for Volvo was born back in 1924. So, if you're interested in the intersection of food, history, and a bit of celebrity, Sturehof is definitely worth a visit!
