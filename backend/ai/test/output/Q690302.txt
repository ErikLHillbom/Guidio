You know, Jon, if you're looking for a thrill that also has a bit of history, you should check out Vilda Musen, or "The Wild Mouse," at Gröna Lund in Stockholm. This roller coaster holds the title of the tallest wild mouse coaster in the world, and it's also one of the fastest! It’s quite the ride for anyone who loves a bit of adrenaline.

Gröna Lund itself is a historic amusement park, which gives Vilda Musen a unique cultural context. If you’re up for it, experiencing the rush of the coaster while taking in the park's rich history could be a fantastic way to enjoy your time in Stockholm!
