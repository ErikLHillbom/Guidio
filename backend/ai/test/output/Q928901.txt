Oh, you’re going to love Köpmangatan, Jon! It’s steeped in history and culture, right in the heart of Gamla stan, the old town of Stockholm. This charming street, known as "The Merchant Street," stretches from the bustling Stortorget square down to Köpmantorget. 

It’s fascinating to think that Köpmangatan was first mentioned way back in 1323. It served as a vital connection for merchants in the Middle Ages, linking the central square to the fish market outside the city’s walls. Imagine the bustling activity that must have occurred here! 

As you stroll along, keep an eye out for the picturesque side streets intersecting it—each with its own story. One notable feature was the old Köpmanporten, or "Merchant's Gate," which used to be at the eastern end before it was taken down in 1685. 

Exploring Köpmangatan is like walking through a living museum, where every step offers a glimpse into Stockholm's vibrant past.
