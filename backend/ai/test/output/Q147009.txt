You know, Jon, if you’re interested in Swedish history, then Tre Kronor, or Three Crowns Castle, has quite the story. It was built by Birger Jarl in the 13th century and later became the royal seat for King Gustav Vasa when he broke free from the Kalmar Union. That’s pretty significant for Sweden!

Interestingly, the name "Tre Kronor" came into use during King Magnus Eriksson's time in the 14th century. However, the castle met a tragic end in 1697 when a massive fire destroyed most of it, taking with it many invaluable royal archives. It was rebuilt later as Stockholm Palace, which stands on the same site today.

Oh, and did you know that Gustavus Adolphus, one of Sweden's most notable kings, was born there? Just a little added trivia for your history-loving self! If you ever want to learn more about it or see where it once stood, I’d love to guide you through that part of Stockholm.
