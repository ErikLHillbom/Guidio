Have you heard about the SS Sankt Erik, Jon? It's a fascinating icebreaker and museum ship right here at the Vasa Museum in Stockholm. Launched back in 1915 as Isbrytaren II, it was Sweden's first large icebreaker, designed specifically to tackle the icy Baltic waters. 

What’s really interesting is how it was built with a unique bow that allows it to lift onto the ice and crush it, along with heeling tanks that help widen the channels by rocking the ship. It served the City of Stockholm for years, ensuring that the waterways remained navigable. In 1958, it underwent a major refit, converting from coal to oil and adding modern features like radar. 

It’s definitely a piece of history that gives you a glimpse into Sweden's maritime culture!
