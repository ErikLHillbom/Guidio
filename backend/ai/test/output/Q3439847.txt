Köpmantorget, or Merchant's Square, is a charming little spot in Gamla stan, the heart of Stockholm's old town. It’s interesting because, despite its name, it was never actually used as a market. The square first appeared on a map in 1733, marking its location at the eastern end of Köpmangatan, which leads to the bustling Stortorget.

Historically, before 1685, the area was significant enough to have been part of a city gate, and the nearby vault was a key feature during the Middle Ages. If you're into art and history, you’ll appreciate the bronze sculpture of Saint George and the Dragon that graces the square since 1912—it's a replica of a famous original housed in Storkyrkan. Exploring this little square, Jon, offers a glimpse into Stockholm's rich past!
