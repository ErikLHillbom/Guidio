You know, Jon, the Blanche Theatre, or Blancheteatern as it’s known in Swedish, has some really fascinating history. It opened way back on March 31, 1879, right next to Kungsträdgården in Stockholm. Originally, it was a vaudeville theater, but by the mid-1880s, it transformed into a more arts-focused venue.

Between 1917 and 1926, under Ernst Eklund's direction, it offered a great mix of revues, classic dramas, and even debates, which must have made for some lively performances. In its later years, it became an alternative spot for the Swedish Royal Opera. Unfortunately, the building was demolished in 1965 during a big redevelopment in the Norrmalm district. It’s a shame we don’t have it anymore, but the stories from that era must have been quite something!
