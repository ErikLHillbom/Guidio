You know, Tyska Brunnsplan is quite the charming little spot in Gamla stan, right in the heart of Stockholm. It’s this triangular public square nestled between Svartmangatan and Själagårdsgatan, and it has a fascinating history.

Back in the day, this area was known for its well, which was significant enough to be referred to as a "German Well" in the 17th century. The square was redesigned in the late 1700s to make room for horse-drawn vehicles, and the city architect Erik Palmstedt ended up creating this neat little space with a backdrop of variously sized windows and a classic well featuring doric columns.

Oh, and if you're into synagogues, the first one in Stockholm was established right on the square's eastern side in the 19th century. So, there’s a rich blend of history and culture waiting for you to explore there, Jon!
