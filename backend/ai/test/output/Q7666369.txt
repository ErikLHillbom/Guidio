If you’re interested in history and culture, Södra Latin might catch your attention, Jon. This upper secondary school in Södermalm has a fascinating legacy, dating back to its origins in 1654. The current building, opened in 1891, showcases beautiful architecture designed to let in natural light, featuring a striking orange-red brick facade and a unique semicircular assembly hall.

Originally a boys-only school until 1961, Södra Latin has evolved over the years and is now renowned for its arts education. Programs in music and drama were introduced in the late 20th century, helping it become a hub for creative talents. Speaking of talent, several notable alumni, like actors Alexander Skarsgård and Noomi Rapace, as well as Nobel laureate Svante Pääbo, have walked its halls.
