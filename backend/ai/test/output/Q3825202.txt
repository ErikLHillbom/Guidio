Have you heard about Södra Teatern, Jon? It's the oldest theatre in Stockholm, nestled right at Mosebacke torg on Södermalm. This place has quite a history, inaugurated back in 1859, and was designed by architect Johan Fredrik Åbom. 

What’s really fascinating is that Södra Teatern isn't just a traditional theatre; it has a vibrant mix of events, from concerts to international performances. In fact, over 600 events were held there in 2010 alone! Plus, there are two restaurants and outdoor terraces, making it a lively spot to enjoy some culture and maybe grab a bite. If you're interested in the blend of history and contemporary arts, this venue is definitely worth checking out!
