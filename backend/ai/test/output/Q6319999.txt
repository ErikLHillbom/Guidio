You’ll love the charm of Järntorgsgatan, Jon! This historic street runs through Gamla stan, Stockholm's old town, connecting the bustling Järntorget square to Slussplan. It’s often referred to as “The Big Street,” which reflects its importance back in the day when it served as a main route from Södermalm.

The street is lined with lovely middle-class dwellings that date back centuries, creating a unique atmosphere that's rich in history and culture. Interestingly, it was documented as far back as 1685, but the area was used for iron storage even earlier, dating back to the 14th century. 

As you explore, keep an eye out for Bacchi Wapen, a notable landmark along the way. It’s fascinating to stroll down a street that has been so integral to Stockholm's past!
