Oh, you’re in for a treat with Skeppsholmsbron, Jon! This beautiful bridge is a historic gem in central Stockholm, connecting the areas of Blasieholmen and Skeppsholmen. Spanning 165 meters, it boasts a unique design with five arches and is notable for being the first forged iron bridge in Sweden, built back in 1861.

What’s really striking are the Gilded Crowns you’ll see at the midpoint of the bridge; they symbolize Sweden and its royal family. The bridge has quite a history, starting with a wooden version built in the early 17th century. In fact, after a fire damaged the original, the current steel bridge was inaugurated over a hundred years later.

In 1935, the bridge was classified as a historical landmark, so you can rest assured that its charm and exterior will remain untouched. It’s a lovely spot to appreciate both the history and the culture of Stockholm!
