As we explore Gamla stan, you'll definitely want to check out Triewaldsgränd. This charming alley runs from Järntorget square down to Kornhamnstorg and Munkbroleden. It has a fascinating history linked to Mårten Triewald the Elder, a German farrier who made quite a name for himself in the late 17th century. His legacy continued through his sons, one of whom co-founded the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences!

Interestingly, on a map from 1733, it was labeled as "Triwalds gränd," but there's a fun twist — it’s often dubbed “Trivialsgränd,” which adds a quirky touch to its character. As you wander through, you’ll really feel the rich history and culture of the area come alive.
