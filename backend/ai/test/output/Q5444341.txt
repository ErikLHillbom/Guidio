Ferkens Gränd is a charming little alley in Gamla stan, connecting Skeppsbron to Österlånggatan. It’s one of those hidden gems that really captures the essence of Stockholm’s old town. The name comes from a simple restaurant called "Farken" or "Ferken," dating back to the early 17th century. Isn’t it interesting that it was named after a pig? The tavern had a colorful history, being run by a woman named Louise back in 1602 before it was declared unfit in 1687. If you're keen on exploring the rich history and culture of the area, this alley is definitely worth a stroll, Jon!
