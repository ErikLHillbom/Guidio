You’ll definitely want to check out Södra Dryckesgränd while you're in Gamla stan, Jon. This charming alley, which translates to "Southern Drunkenness Alley," connects Skeppsbron to Järntorgsgatan and runs parallel to Norra Dryckesgränd. 

It has a rich history, appearing in various forms in records dating back to the early 16th century. The name's origin remains a bit of a mystery, adding to its intrigue. Strolling through here is like stepping back in time, with the cobblestone streets and old-world atmosphere. It’s a lovely spot to soak in the history and culture of Stockholm!
