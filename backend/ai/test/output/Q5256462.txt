You know, Jon, if you're interested in history and culture, Den gyldene freden is a must-visit spot in Gamla stan. This restaurant, which translates to "The Golden Peace," has an incredible backstory tied to the Peace of Nystad in 1721. It's one of the oldest restaurants in the world still in its original setting, having opened its doors in 1722. 

The atmosphere inside is like stepping back in time, with its 18th-century tavern charm largely intact. Over the years, it’s been a favorite gathering place for many famous Swedish artists and writers. In fact, the Swedish Academy holds its weekly dinner there, adding to the place's cultural significance. You might even feel the echoes of songs from poets like Carl Michael Bellman and Evert Taube while you’re there. It’s a real slice of Swedish heritage that perfectly blends history with dining.
