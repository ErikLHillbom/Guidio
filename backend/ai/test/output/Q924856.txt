You’ll find Strömsborg, a charming little islet in central Stockholm, nestled between the bustling bridges of Centralbron and Vasabron. It’s part of Gamla Stan, the old town, and you can easily access it via Strömsborgsbron. 

Strömsborg's history is quite fascinating. It was owned by a merchant named Berge Olofson Ström back in 1740, who built a stone house surrounded by lime trees, giving it the name "Stream's Castle." Over the years, it has transformed from a picturesque retreat to a more urban setting, especially with the construction of the modern palace that replaced earlier structures. 

Today, Strömsborg is home to various offices, including the Ukrainian Institute in Sweden as of September 2023. Even though it’s changed a lot, it still carries a rich history that reflects Stockholm's cultural evolution. If you're into history and culture, Strömsborg offers a unique snapshot of the city's past!
