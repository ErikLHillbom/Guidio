Oh, you’re going to love Blasieholmen, Jon! This charming peninsula in central Stockholm has a fascinating history. Originally a small island called Käpplingen, it was transformed into a peninsula in the 17th century when it connected to Norrmalm. 

What's really neat is that it’s home to the Nationalmuseum, so if you're into art and history, that’s a must-see! You'll also find some lovely hotels and office buildings there, making it a vibrant part of the city. Plus, Blasieholmen is connected to the island of Skeppsholmen by the Skeppsholmsbron bridge, which adds to its scenic charm. Even though the Blasieholmen Church was demolished back in 1964, the area still has a rich cultural vibe. It's definitely worth a stroll!
