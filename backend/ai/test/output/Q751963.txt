You know, Jon, if you’re exploring Stockholm, you should definitely check out PUB, which has an intriguing history. This department store opened way back in 1882 and was founded by Paul Urbanus Bergström, whose initials actually inspired the name. It’s situated at Hötorget right in the city center, and it quickly became a major retail hub.

After Bergström passed away in 1934, it changed hands and eventually transformed parts of the building into a hotel. Today, the last remnant of the store has been converted into the Scandic Hotel Haymarket, blending history with modern hospitality.

A couple of interesting tidbits: during a visit in 1917, Lenin was even taken to PUB to get a new suit before heading back to Russia. Plus, Greta Garbo worked there for a short time before venturing into acting. It’s definitely a spot that reflects a lot of the cultural shifts in Sweden!
