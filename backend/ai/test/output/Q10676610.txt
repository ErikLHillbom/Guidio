You’re in for a treat if you visit the Museum of Spirits, Jon! Nestled on Djurgården island in Stockholm, this museum dives deep into Sweden's rich history of wine and spirits. You’ll get to see vintage production equipment, fascinating labels from yesteryear, and even an exhibit on Swedish drinking habits. 

One of the highlights is the Absolut Art Collection, featuring nearly 900 pieces by renowned artists like Andy Warhol and Damien Hirst, all inspired by the iconic Absolut Vodka bottle. It's not just about spirits; it’s a blend of art and culture that you won’t want to miss during your exploration of Stockholm!
