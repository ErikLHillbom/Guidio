Oh, you’re in for a treat with the Stockholm Music Museum! Founded back in 1899, this museum showcases around 5,500 musical instruments, focusing on both Western art music and Scandinavian folk traditions. It really embodies the rich musical heritage of Sweden.

What’s fascinating is that the museum is housed in the historic Crown Bakery, which dates back to the 17th century. Can you believe it’s Stockholm’s oldest industrial building? It’s had quite the journey, serving various roles, including a bakery for the armed forces until 1958. 

If you’re into history and culture, Jon, this is a perfect spot to explore how music and instruments have evolved over the years. Plus, you can even check out their collection online if you’re curious about specific pieces!
