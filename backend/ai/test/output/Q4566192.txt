You know, Kindstugatan is quite a gem in Gamla Stan, and it’s rich in history. This street stretches from Brända Tomten to Tyska Brinken, and it's crossed by a couple of other charming streets, Svartmangatan and Skomakargatan.

One interesting fact, Jon, is that the name has evolved over the centuries, with its oldest version dating back to 1449. While the exact origin of the name isn't clear, it likely refers to colorful local stories, possibly even fights. Imagine the medieval vibe of this area, where it was once known as "Cross Street," connecting the old city gates!

As you walk down, you’ll notice a few notable buildings. For instance, Number 4 holds the Törnska huset with its intriguing portals and a history tied to a former city mayor. Then there’s Number 8, where a pioneering doctor lived and introduced obstetrics to Sweden.

And at Number 14, there was a tavern where the poet Lasse Lucidor met a tragic end during a duel! The stories embedded in the walls here really bring the culture and history of Stockholm to life. It’s a great little stroll if you’re into that kind of thing!
