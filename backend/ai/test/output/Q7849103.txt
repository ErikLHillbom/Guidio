You know, Jon, if you're wandering around Gamla stan, Trädgårdsgatan is definitely worth a stroll. This charming little street runs just south of the Royal Palace and leads you toward Stortorget, the main square. It’s rich in history, having been laid out in the 15th century as it passed through what used to be vegetable gardens for the palace. 

What's fascinating is that the street was originally nameless and referred to as "the North Alley" for a long time. It wasn't until later that it picked up the name Trädgårdsgatan, which translates to "Garden Street," thanks to the royal gardens that were once nearby. You’ll also find some gates leading to a lovely area called Bollhustäppan on the northern side. 

It’s a great spot to soak in not just the history but also the culture of Stockholm, so make sure to check it out while you're exploring the area!
