Exercishuset is a fascinating piece of history right on Skeppsholmen, Jon. Built in 1853, it originally served as a training facility for Navy staff, helping them master the art of handling rowing vessels. Imagine a time when 54 men worked together to row long dinghies!

The building has evolved quite a bit since then. After various transformations, it became part of the Moderna Museet in 1958, which has since grown to include the Swedish Centre for Architecture and Design. So, when you visit, you’re not just stepping into a modern cultural hub but also a historical landmark that reflects the evolution of warfare and art in Sweden. It’s a perfect blend of history and culture for someone with your interests!
