You know, Jon, Strömbadet was quite an intriguing part of Stockholm’s history. Opened in 1884, it was the first large cold bathhouse in the city, situated in Norrström just north of Riddarholmen. The building, designed by the Kumlien brothers in a beautiful neo-Renaissance style, was entirely made of wood, which made it stand out at the time.

It featured several pools, including a notable 39-meter men’s pool. However, by 1933, the water was deemed unhealthy for bathing, leading to the unfortunate demolition of Strömbadet in 1936. It’s fascinating how a place that was once a hub for relaxation and culture has now been lost to time, don’t you think?
