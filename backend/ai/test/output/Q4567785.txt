You know, Jon, if you’re interested in history and culture, Björngårdsteatern is quite a fascinating spot in Stockholm. It dates back to the early 1640s and is considered possibly the oldest theatre in Scandinavia—though it’s a bit shrouded in mystery. Managed by Christian Thum, it was originally a popular tavern, which gives it a charming, rustic vibe.

The name "Björngårdsteatern" translates to "Bear Yard Theater," harking back to its location where blood sports and bear-baiting used to take place. Thum was notably active in the local arts scene, even leading a German theater company at the royal court of Queen Christina of Sweden before taking on this tavern-theater hybrid. 

While there’s not a lot of confirmed theatrical activity from Björngårdsteatern, it played an important role in the cultural fabric of Stockholm during its time. It was even a favored local spot until it was destroyed in 1877. Imagine the stories those walls could tell, right?
