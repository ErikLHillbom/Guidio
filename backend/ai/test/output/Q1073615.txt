You know, Jon, if you're into history and culture, Chinateatern is a fascinating spot to check out. Located right in Berzelii Park, this private theatre, often just called "China," has quite a rich history. It was originally built in 1928 as a movie theatre, but over time, it transformed into a vibrant stage for revues, comedies, and musicals. 

Back in the 1980s, it really hit its stride, becoming a popular venue for various Swedish theatre companies, including the esteemed Royal Dramatic Theatre. So, if you’re in the mood for a cultural experience, this place definitely has a story to tell! Plus, it's conveniently located next to Berns Salonger, which is also worth a visit.
