You’ll love exploring Munkbrogatan, Jon! This charming street is nestled in the western part of Gamla stan, Stockholm’s historic old town. It runs south between Munkbron and Mälartorget squares and has a rich history, having emerged from the reconstruction after a major fire in the 17th century.

The name itself pays homage to the Greyfriars abbey, which once stood nearby. Interestingly, it was referred to as Munkbrohamnsgatan back in 1664! Just a few years ago, the street was beautifully cobbled, enhancing its historic feel. It’s a wonderful spot to soak up the culture and history of Stockholm.
