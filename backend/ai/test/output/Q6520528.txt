You’re in for a treat exploring Lejonstedts Gränd, Jon! This charming alleyway in Gamla stan is steeped in history. It stretches from Stora Nygatan to Mälartorget and is beautifully flanked by other historic streets like Tyska Brinken.

What’s really fascinating is its connection to Anders Lejonstedt, a notable figure from the late 17th century, who owned parts of this area with his brother. The alley itself came into being after the great fire of 1625, which led to the reconstruction of the western part of the old town. Before that, the area was more of a defense point with some agricultural activity.

As you stroll through, imagine the rich history of goods being traded here and the architectural evolution that has taken place. It’s a slice of Stockholm's past right at your feet!
