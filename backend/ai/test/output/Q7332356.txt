Riddarhusgränd is a charming alley nestled in Gamla stan, the historic heart of Stockholm. This picturesque stretch runs from Riddarhustorget square to Vasabron bridge, nestled between the impressive Swedish House of Knights and the elegant Bonde Palace. 

It’s fascinating to think that this alley, first recorded in 1718, was initially intended as an extension of Stora Nygatan. If you enjoy history, Jon, you’ll appreciate how it reflects the city’s evolution after the great fire of 1625. The ornate façade of the House of Knights is particularly stunning, adorned with intricate stone decorations that were meticulously restored in 2004. 

The area has also become part of a lighting project to enhance its beauty at night, making it a lovely spot to explore after sunset. It’s a perfect blend of culture and history, don’t you think?
