Have you heard of Torgdragargränd, Jon? It’s a charming little alley in Gamla stan, connecting Västerlånggatan to Kornhamnstorg. This spot has quite the history—prior to 1981, it was actually closed off with a gate! 

The name comes from the market workers who would carry their goods through the alley, known as "Torgdragare" or "Square draughters." It’s fascinating how these folks used to bring their stalls to life every morning, and you might even imagine them sharing a herring and schnaps in the alley's quiet corners. It’s a lovely blend of culture and history, right in the heart of old Stockholm!
