You know, Jon, while you're exploring Stockholm, you might want to check out Karl Johansslussen. This lock is not just a practical structure; it's steeped in history and connects the Söderström river with both Riddarfjärden and Saltsjön. It was originally completed in 1935 and has a fascinating backstory, stemming from earlier versions of locks that date back to the 17th century. 

The current lock serves mainly pleasure and sightseeing boats, and there’s something quite charming about watching them navigate through. Interestingly, the area was also undergoing significant reconstruction from 2016 to 2021, so there’s a modern touch mixed with this rich history. 

If you're keen on both history and culture, you'll find that the environment around Karl Johansslussen has transformed dramatically over centuries, especially as it evolved from a military necessity to a bustling commercial hub. Plus, the statue of Charles XIV John nearby adds an artistic flair to the whole experience. It’s definitely worth a visit!
