Ah, the SS Drottningholm is quite a fascinating piece of history, Jon! Built in 1909, it originally went by the name Valkyrian. Over the years, it’s had quite the journey, including a stint as Nya Strömma Kanal before settling on its current name in 1969. 

This charming steamship now operates scenic cruises between Stockholm and Drottningholm Palace, allowing passengers to soak in the beauty of the archipelago. It can carry about 150 guests at a leisurely pace of 8 knots, so you’ll have plenty of time to enjoy the surroundings. 

It’s also a listed historic ship in Sweden, which adds to its cultural significance. If you're up for a cruise, it could be a lovely way to connect with the local history while enjoying the stunning views!
