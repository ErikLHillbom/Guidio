So, Jon, have you heard about the Siege of Stockholm in 1520? It's quite a fascinating chapter in Swedish history. This siege was initiated by Danish King Christian II during the Dano-Swedish War. It all kicked off in May when his fleet blockaded the city, while his army set up positions around the suburbs.

What’s intriguing is that Christian initially hesitated to attack, opting for bribes of salt and herring to win the city over. However, most of Stockholm's defenders, led by Christina Gyllenstierna, held strong with their impressive artillery. It turned into a long, drawn-out affair, and by September, the siege finally ended with Christian entering the city with a sizable force.

But here’s where it gets grim. After his coronation, a dark event known as the Stockholm Bloodbath unfolded, leading to the execution of many noble figures and citizens. It’s a stark reminder of the turbulent times back then.
