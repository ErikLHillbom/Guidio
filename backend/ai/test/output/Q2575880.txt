You know, Jon, if you're exploring Gamla Stan, you really have to check out Mårten Trotzigs Gränd. It’s known as the narrowest street in Stockholm, with a width that shrinks to just 90 centimeters at its tightest point! 

This charming alley dates back to the late 16th century and is named after Mårten Trotzig, a wealthy merchant who made quite the name for himself by dealing in iron and copper. It’s fascinating to think about how he lived and worked here back in the day. The alley has a bit of a dramatic history too; it was once closed off in the 1800s and only reopened in 1945. 

You’ll love wandering through, taking in the historic atmosphere while walking up its 37 steps. It really gives you a sense of the old town's character, doesn’t it?
