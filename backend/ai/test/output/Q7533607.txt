You’ll find the Nautical Chart Department on the charming islet of Skeppsholmen in the heart of Stockholm, Jon. This historic building was completed in the early 1870s and designed by Victor Ringheim, who crafted a lovely two-storey structure that has evolved over the years. 

Originally, it served as a storage spot for nautical charts, crucial for maritime navigation at the time. Interestingly, before this building was erected, the site was home to a tavern known as "The Rooster," celebrated in the poetry of Carl Michael Bellman. 

The building has seen quite a bit of change; after housing the Museum of Architecture for several years, it now showcases Swedish design through Designforum Svensk Form. It's a fascinating piece of Stockholm’s history and culture that reflects the city's maritime heritage.
