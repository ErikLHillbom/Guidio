You know, Jon, the Norwegian Exhibition in 1943 was quite a significant event held in Sweden. It aimed to showcase and celebrate Norwegian culture and history during a tough time, particularly with Norway under German occupation. 

The exhibition kicked off on March 10 at Thulehuset in Stockholm and ran until April 27. It was opened by Prince Eugen, alongside various dignitaries, including representatives from the Allied nations. That alone highlights how important this event was for fostering cultural ties.

You'll find it fascinating that the exhibition featured stunning works from renowned artists like Edvard Munch and Christian Krohg, along with impressive statues by Gustav Vigeland. Notably, there were also memorials honoring Norwegian patriots who sacrificed their lives for freedom, which adds a poignant touch to the whole experience.
