You know, Jon, if you're interested in the history and culture of Stockholm, the Stockholm City Museum is a fantastic place to visit. It's located in the Södra Stadshuset at Slussen on Södermalm, and it showcases the rich history of the city. The building itself dates back to 1685, and the museum opened in 1942 after moving in during the 1930s.

With over 300,000 historical items and 3 million photographs, it really dives deep into the city's past. They have two main exhibitions: one that tells the story of Stockholm from its earliest settlements to modern times, and another focused on architecture and building preservation throughout different historical styles. 

Plus, if you’re up for a little adventure, they offer themed city walks, like the ABBA City Walk or the Stieg Larsson Millennium Tour, which could be a fun way to explore the city while learning more about its cultural landmarks. It sounds like a great stop for someone like you, doesn’t it?
