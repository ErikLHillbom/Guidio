Artillerigatan is quite an interesting spot in Östermalm, Jon! This street not only runs from the picturesque Nybroviken harbor but also has a rich history tied to Stockholm's military past. It used to be split into three sections before being unified under the name Artillerigatan in 1885, reflecting its connection to the Royal Artillery.

As you stroll along, you'll discover notable landmarks like the Swedish Army Museum, which is housed in what was once the artillery yard. The area is also home to the beautiful Hedvig Eleonora Church, dating back to 1737, and the Music Museum nearby. It's a lovely stretch, about 1.5 kilometers long, and a perfect blend of history and culture!
