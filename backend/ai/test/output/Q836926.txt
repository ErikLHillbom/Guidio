You know, Jon, Jetline was quite the roller coaster at Gröna Lund in Stockholm. It opened in 1988 and was famous for its unique curved lift hill, which really set it apart from other rides. That first drop was modified in 2000 to be longer and steeper, complete with a tunnel—sounds thrilling, right? 

Sadly, Jetline was permanently closed after a serious accident in June 2023, which overshadowed its history. Before that, it provided a ride experience lasting about a minute and a half, featuring some exciting banked turns and helices. It’s definitely a part of Gröna Lund's story, reflecting both the excitement of amusement parks and the importance of safety in thrilling experiences.
