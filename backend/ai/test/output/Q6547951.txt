In Gamla stan, Lilla Nygatan is a charming little street that has a rich history, Jon. It stretches from Munkbron square to Kornhamnstorg and is dotted with several intriguing side streets. This area was part of a city plan following the great fire of 1625, with the street likely dating back to around 1630. 

What’s fascinating is that it was originally referred to by various names over the years, with the current name becoming prominent in 1720. If you appreciate history, you'll enjoy learning about the archaeological finds at its junction with Tyska Brinken, where remnants of a 14th-century defensive tower were uncovered. 

Make sure to check out the Postmuseum at Number 6. This building was the only post office in Stockholm from its opening in 1720 until the museum's inauguration in 1906. It features impressive architecture with green marble columns and a beautifully restored interior. It sounds like a perfect spot for someone like you, Jon, who is into history and culture!
