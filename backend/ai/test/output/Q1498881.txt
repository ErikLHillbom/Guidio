You know, Jon, one of the most fascinating events in Stockholm's history is the Norrmalmstorg robbery from August 1973. It was a dramatic bank heist at Kreditbanken in Norrmalmstorg Square, where a man named Jan-Erik Olsson took four hostages during a standoff that lasted five days. 

What makes this incident stand out is that it was the first crime in Sweden broadcast live on television. The hostages ended up forming a surprising bond with their captors, leading to the term "Stockholm syndrome," which refers to when hostages develop feelings for their captors. This was not just a simple robbery; it sparked significant interest in psychology and criminology.

Olsson's friend, Clark Olofsson, was brought in during negotiations, and although he had a criminal background, he was seen more as a mediator than a co-conspirator. Eventually, police used tear gas to end the standoff, and thankfully, all hostages emerged unharmed.

If you’re interested in how this event has permeated popular culture, there have been several films and series inspired by it, including a Netflix show titled "Clark." It’s definitely a unique chapter in Stockholm's history and showcases a mix of crime, psychology, and media influence that’s worth exploring!
