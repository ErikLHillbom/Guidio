You’ll find Slussplan at the southern end of Gamla Stan, Jon, right by the bustling public square, Karl Johans Torg. This charming street runs from Skeppsbron to Katarinavägen, and it’s steeped in history. 

What’s particularly interesting is that it was created in 1854 alongside the statue of Charles XIV John, designed by Bengt Erland Fogelberg. That statue has been a significant landmark since its inauguration. 

The name Slussplan came into use officially in 1872, after the construction of a lock system that manages the water flow from Lake Mälaren to the Baltic Sea. So, if you're keen on culture and history, this area has layers of fascinating stories just waiting to be explored!
