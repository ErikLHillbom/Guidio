You know, Kastellet is a fascinating spot to check out in central Stockholm. This small citadel sits on Kastellholmen, and its history dates back to 1667 when it was originally fortified by the notable Erik Dahlbergh. It’s interesting how it fell into disrepair after the fleet moved to Karlskrona but was rebuilt between 1846 and 1848 after a dramatic explosion.

The structure features a striking round tower made of red brick, which stands about 20 meters high. What’s really cool, Jon, is that it played a role during World War II as part of the city's air defense, equipped with anti-aircraft guns for protection. Every day, they raise the Military Ensign of Sweden at the top, symbolizing peace. If you're into history and culture, this is definitely a spot to explore!
