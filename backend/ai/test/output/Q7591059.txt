You know, Jon, if you're interested in history and culture, St. Paul's Church in Södermalm is definitely worth a visit. Originally built in 1876, this neo-Gothic brick structure was designed by the Kumlien brothers, who were quite renowned in their time. 

It started as the first Methodist church in Sweden back in 1868 but has undergone some changes over the years. In 2013, it became part of the Uniting Church in Sweden, and then in 2015, it was sold to a local charitable organization due to declining attendance. The church is located in Mariatorget, a lovely square that makes for a nice stroll. If you enjoy unique architectural designs and a bit of local history, this spot is definitely one to check out!
