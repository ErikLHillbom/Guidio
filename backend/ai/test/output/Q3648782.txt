You know, Jon, Söder Torn is quite the landmark in Stockholm! Standing about 86 meters tall, this high-rise building has 25 floors and is nestled right next to Fatbursparken on Södermalm. It’s fascinating to think that this site was once a lake called Fatburen, which was filled in during the urban expansion of the 1800s.

The tower was designed by Danish architect Henning Larsen, although he originally intended for it to be even taller with 40 floors. However, city planners had other ideas and cut it down to size. You'll notice its unique octagonal shape, which gives it a distinctive profile.

If you’re looking for stunning views, the top floor is a glass-enclosed party room that offers panoramic vistas of the city. Plus, right at the base, there’s a captivating fountain sculpture by artist Niki de Saint Phalle that many people stop to admire. It’s definitely a blend of history, culture, and modern urban living that makes Söder Torn a notable spot in Stockholm!
