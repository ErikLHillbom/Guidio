You know, Jon, if you're interested in history and culture, the Vasa Museum is a must-visit while you're in Stockholm. It’s located on the beautiful island of Djurgården and showcases the only nearly intact 17th-century ship that’s ever been salvaged—the Vasa. This incredible warship sank on her maiden voyage in 1628, and the museum opened its doors in 1990.

What’s fascinating is how the museum is designed. You can see the Vasa from six different levels, offering an up-close look at this historical marvel. The ship has been renovated with some new parts that are clearly marked, so you can appreciate the original craftsmanship and understand what was lost over the centuries.

Inside, you’ll find various exhibits that dive into the archaeological findings and the history of Sweden during the 17th century. Plus, there's a film that chronicles the ship's recovery—definitely something to check out! It’s no wonder over 45 million people have visited the museum since it opened. If you have time, make sure to explore the four other museum ships moored outside. It’s a perfect blend of history and maritime culture that I think you'd really enjoy!
