You know, Jon, the Katarina Elevator is quite a fascinating piece of Stockholm's history! It’s not just any ordinary lift; it connects Slussen to the heights of Södermalm, offering a shortcut between Katarinavägen and Mosebacke torg. Originally built back in 1881, the lift we see today was reconstructed in 1936 after the Slussen transport interchange was revamped.

It's interesting to think that when the lift first opened, it attracted around 1,500 passengers daily. Can you imagine? In the past, it even had a steam engine before switching to electric power in the early 20th century! And, of course, it recently reopened in October 2023 after a lengthy renovation. So, if you're interested in history and culture, this could be a great stop for you!
