You’ll love hearing about Operakällaren, Jon! This classic restaurant in Kungsträdgården has such a rich history. It first opened its doors in 1787 and started as a regular dining spot. By the 1830s, it became a favorite among artists and politicians, giving it a vibrant cultural atmosphere.

The restaurant underwent significant renovations in the 1870s, transforming into a more upscale venue with elegant touches like linen tablecloths and wooden paneling. It was originally called Terrassen, referencing its lovely open-air section. 

Did you know that it even had a bar opened in 1905 to compete with other high-end restaurants? Fast forward to 1961, after a major renovation led by renowned architects, Operakällaren regained its shine. It briefly lost its Michelin star in 2010 but made a comeback in 2014! If you’re into history and culture, this place is a must-visit in Stockholm.
