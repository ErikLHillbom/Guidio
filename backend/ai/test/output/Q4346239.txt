Ah, Hallwyl Museum is a fantastic spot for someone with your interest in history and culture, Jon! Nestled right in central Stockholm at 4 Hamngatan, it’s housed in the stunning Hallwyl House, which was built between 1893 and 1898 for Count Walther von Hallwyl and his wife, Wilhelmina. They actually lived there during the winter months!

What’s particularly fascinating is that the Countess collected a vast array of artworks during her travels, all intended for the museum she envisioned. When she donated the house to the Swedish state in 1920, she ensured it would remain just as it was, preserving a glimpse into the opulent lives of the Swedish nobility from the late Victorian period.

The museum showcases around 50,000 objects, including exquisite rooms like the silver room and the dining room. Imagine walking through those preserved spaces, Jon, feeling like you've stepped back in time! It officially opened to the public in 1938, so there's plenty of rich history to explore. If you appreciate beautiful architecture and curated collections, this place is definitely worth a visit.
