You know, Jon, if you're exploring the Old Town of Stockholm, you should definitely check out the Axel Oxenstierna Palace. It's a stunning example of Mannerist architecture, designed by the architect Jean de la Vallée in the mid-17th century. 

This palace was built for Chancellor Axel Oxenstierna and served as the headquarters for the Swedish Central Bank from 1668 to 1680. It's quite impressive how well-preserved the building is, especially its exterior and original floor plan. Plus, since it's been a state monument since 1935, there’s a lot of history wrapped up in those walls.

If you appreciate historical structures, this one definitely tells a fascinating story!
