Köpmanbrinken, or "Merchant's Slope," is a fascinating part of Gamla stan, the charming old town of Stockholm. This street features two slopes that connect Österlånggatan to the small Köpmantorget. It's interesting to think about how these slopes have reflected the original paths treaded by the city's first inhabitants.

Historically, the northern slope was known as Fiskestrandsbrinken, named for the bustling fish market that used to thrive nearby until 1520. You might enjoy noticing the statue of St. George and the Dragon, which is a replica from 1912, standing proudly in the area that once was a bustling block, known as Acteon, until it collapsed in 1829. They even flattened the slopes a bit after that incident! 

In the 19th century, they treated each slope as a separate street until they became one in 1885. Exploring Köpmanbrinken will definitely give you a sense of the rich history and culture that defines Stockholm.
