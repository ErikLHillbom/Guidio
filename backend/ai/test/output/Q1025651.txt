You're in for a treat with Café Opera, Jon! Nestled right in the stunning Royal Swedish Opera building, this place has a rich blend of history and culture. It opened its doors in 1980 and transforms from a cozy café and bistro during the day into one of Sweden's busiest nightclubs after 10 PM. 

What’s really cool is the artwork on the ceiling by Vicke Andrén, adding a touch of elegance to the vibrant nightlife. If you’re looking for a mix of culture and fun, it’s a must-visit while you’re in Stockholm!
