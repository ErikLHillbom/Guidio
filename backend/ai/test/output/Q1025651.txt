Jon, if you're interested in a blend of history and vibrant nightlife, you should definitely check out Café Opera in Stockholm. Located in the stunning Royal Swedish Opera building, this spot started as a café in 1980 and transforms into one of Sweden's busiest nightclubs after 10 PM.

During the day, it offers a lovely ambiance as a bistro, brasserie, and tearoom, making it a perfect place to soak in the local culture. And don’t miss the ceiling adorned with beautiful paintings by Vicke Andrén—it adds a unique artistic touch to the experience. So, whether you're looking for a place to relax or dance the night away, Café Opera has a rich cultural vibe that I think you'll really enjoy, Jon!
