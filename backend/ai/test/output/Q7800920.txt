You know, Jon, just around here in Stockholm, there's Tidningsstatistik AB, or TS for short. This company has quite an interesting history, starting way back in 1937 as part of a market research institute. It became independent in 1943 and has been pivotal in measuring newspaper circulation across Sweden ever since.

What’s particularly fascinating is that as of 2008, TS monitored a total circulation of 3.72 million copies for daily newspapers. Some of the big hitters like *Aftonbladet* and *Dagens Nyheter* are included in that mix. Plus, they also track journals and magazines—22.7 million copies, including popular titles like *ICA-kuriren*. 

Their stats are crucial for advertising as well, helping measure circulation for free newspapers and even electronic newsletters. It’s amazing how this small company has played such a significant role in Sweden's media landscape, don’t you think?
