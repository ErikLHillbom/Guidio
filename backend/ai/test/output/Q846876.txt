You know, Jon, if you’re interested in the darker chapters of Stockholm’s history, the Stockholm Bloodbath is a major highlight. This event took place from November 7 to 9 in 1520, right after Christian II was crowned king of Sweden. It led to the tragic execution of nearly 100 people, many of whom were part of the aristocracy supporting the Sture party, which opposed Christian's rule.

What makes it particularly intriguing is how it stemmed from political tensions between pro-unionists, like Archbishop Gustav Trolle, and anti-unionists. After a lavish banquet, Christian invited key Swedish leaders to a meeting at Tre Kronor castle, only to have them arrested based on accusations of heresy. The executions that followed were brutal and swift, with many noblemen meeting their end in the great square of Stockholm.

This massacre didn’t just mark a turning point in Swedish history—it earned Christian the nickname "Kristian Tyrann" or "Christian the Tyrant." It also ignited a lasting animosity between Sweden and Denmark, shaping the national consciousness for centuries. If you find tales of political intrigue and tragedy fascinating, this is definitely a spot to explore during your time in Stockholm!
