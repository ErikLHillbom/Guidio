Ah, Gåsgränd! It's a charming little alley tucked away in Gamla stan, Stockholm’s old town. This place has a rich history, Jon. It was originally known as Grågåsens gränd in the 15th century, named after a woman named Ragnhild Grågås. Can you believe it dates back to at least 1492? 

As you stroll through, you’ll notice it connects several streets and leads down to Munkbron, which is right by the waterfront. There’s also a small square called Gåstorget at the top of the alley, perfect for a quick breather or a photo opportunity. It’s fascinating to think about all the changes this place has seen over the centuries!
