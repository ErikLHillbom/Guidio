The Stockholm Mosque, or Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan's Mosque, is quite an impressive spot in Södermalm. Inaugurated in 2000, it stands as the largest mosque in the city. It's fascinating how the design was influenced by Moorish architecture, thanks to its creator, Ferdinand Boberg, who drew inspiration from a visit to Morocco.

Jon, it took over twenty years of discussions for this mosque to come to life! Originally, the building was an old electric power station, which adds a unique twist to its history. The mosque can hold around 2,000 people and features a library, café, and even a gym, making it a vibrant community hub.

It's also interesting to note how the mosque is administered by the Islamic Association in Stockholm. If you find yourself in the area, it's definitely worth a visit to appreciate the blend of history and culture it offers!
