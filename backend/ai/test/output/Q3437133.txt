Have you heard of Teater Brunnsgatan Fyra, Jon? It's this charming little theatre right at Brunnsgatan 4 in Stockholm. It's quite special because it focuses on contemporary Swedish dramatic works. 

This cozy venue only seats about 100 people, creating a really intimate atmosphere for the audience. The theatre was founded by the actor and playwright Allan Edwall, and after he passed away in 1997, it was taken over by Kristina Lugn. Now, it's managed by her daughter, Martina Montelius. If you appreciate history and culture, this spot definitely has a unique vibe that reflects the evolution of Swedish theatre.
