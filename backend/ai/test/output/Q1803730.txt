You’ll find the Van der Nootska Palace on Sankt Paulsgatan in Södermalm, Jon. This fascinating building was constructed back in 1671-1672 by architect Mathias Spieler for Thomas van der Noot, a Dutch-born military officer. The facade really stands out with its pilasters, festoons, and even mermaids carved in sandstone.

Originally, it served as a residence for Dutch ministers and underwent several transformations over the years. By the late 19th century, it was in danger of being demolished but was saved and beautifully restored by Jean Jahnsson, who filled it with a remarkable collection of art and literature. It’s interesting to note that after Jahnsson's financial troubles, many of his treasures were donated to the Stockholm City Museum.

Today, the palace is used for conferences and banquets, so if you're interested in history and culture, it’s worth a visit to appreciate its rich past and stunning architecture!
