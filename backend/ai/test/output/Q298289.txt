The museum showcases a diverse array of artifacts from East Asia, including Japan, Korea, India, and China. You can explore everything from ancient archaeological pieces to classical art and even contemporary cultural displays. Some highlights include stunning sculptures like a Jain Tirthankara from the 8th century and an exquisite Ganesha from the Chola dynasty.
