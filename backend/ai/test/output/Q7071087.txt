Have you heard of Nygränd, Jon? It's this charming little alley in Gamla stan, connecting Skeppsbron to Österlånggatan. The name actually means "New Alley," which is a nod to its historical roots.  

Back in the day, before the early 1520s, this spot was bustling with activity as a fish market. Picture a lively square filled with vendors, right near Köpmangatan, which leads to the central square, Stortorget. 

One of the coolest features is the elaborate portal at number 2 on Nygränd—it really captures the essence of the old town's architecture. It’s a neat little gem that reflects Stockholm's rich history and culture!
