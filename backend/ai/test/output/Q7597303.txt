Oh, you'll love Stallbron, Jon! It’s this charming arch bridge in Gamla stan, the old town of Stockholm. Stretching about 20 meters over the Stallkanalen, it connects some key spots—Riksgatan by the Parliament Building on Helgeandsholmen and the square Mynttorget on Stadsholmen.

What’s fascinating is its history. Stallbron, named in the late 19th century, stands on a site where the oldest bridge in the city once existed. Originally, there was a wooden bridge that served as part of the northern gate of Stockholm. The bridge has undergone several transformations since then, with the current steel structure being inaugurated in 1904. 

You'll also notice the parallel bridge added in 1982, which connects the Parliament to the Government Offices. It’s a vibrant spot where history mingles with the hustle of modern-day Stockholm. Definitely worth a visit while you’re exploring the area!
