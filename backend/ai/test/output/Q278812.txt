You know, Jon, while exploring Gamla stan, you’ll definitely want to check out Kråkgränd, or Crow Alley as it's known in English. It’s a charming little alley that runs between Skeppsbron and Österlånggatan. 

What’s really intriguing is its historical background. It’s named after Knut Nilsson Kråka, a notable figure from the early 17th century who had quite the ups and downs in his career. He started off as one of the city’s elders but ended up embroiled in tax issues. It’s fascinating how even a tiny alley like this carries stories from the past! 

As you walk through, you can really feel the rich culture and history of Stockholm. It’s definitely a spot to appreciate as you wander the old town!
