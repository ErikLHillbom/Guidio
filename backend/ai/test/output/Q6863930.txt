You know, Mindre Teatern, or The Smaller Theatre, has quite an intriguing history. Established in 1842 by Anders Lindeberg, it was a response to the end of the Royal Dramatic Theatre's monopoly. Over the years, it became a vibrant cultural hub that rivaled the Royal Theatre.

What’s really interesting, Jon, is that it was also called Nya Teatern (The New Theatre) and Lindeberska Teatern after its founder. By 1863, it was sold to the Royal Theatre and transformed into their new home for 45 years. They even referred to it as "The Small Stage" compared to the larger Royal Swedish Opera.

Unfortunately, as time went on, the building was seen as inadequate and was finally demolished in 1908 after the completion of a new Royal Theatre. It’s fascinating how this little theatre played such a significant role in Stockholm's cultural landscape!
