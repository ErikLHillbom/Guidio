  "text": "<h1>Skottgränd</h1>\n<p><strong>Skottgränd</strong> (Swedish: \"Scotch Alley\") is an alley in Gamla stan, the old town of Stockholm Sweden, stretching from Skeppsbron to Österlånggatan.</p>\n<p>Apparently the name came into use by the end of the 16th century. It reflects the immigration of Scots, Englishmen and Dutch people who settled in the alley and were, arguably, collectively referred to as 'Scots'. Possibly, the name might refer to the name of an individual, even though the records do not give any details about it.</p>",
