  "text": "<h1>Lilla Hoparegränd</h1>\n<p><strong>Lilla Hoparegränd</strong> is an alley in Gamla stan, the old town of Stockholm, Sweden. Passing between Skeppsbron and Österlånggatan it forms a parallel street to Ferkens Gränd, Gaffelgränd, Pelikansgränd and Johannesgränd.</p>\n<p>The street appears in historical records as <em>Wargzfrenden</em> in 1550, <em>Warge Grenden</em> in 1646, <em>Vargsgränden</em> during the 16th-17th centuries and finally as <em>Lilla Hopare gr.</em> in 1771. Why the alley was originally called <em>Varggränd</em> (\"Wolf Alley\") is not known, however, <em>Varg</em> is still a common proper name in Sweden and might refer to an individual associated with the alley. The present name refers to a <em>Michel Hoper</em> or <em>Hopare</em>. Hoper is of Dutch or Frisian origin and means hooper (e.g. maker of barrels).</p>",
