  "text": "<h1>Norrmalm</h1>\n<p><strong>Norrmalm</strong> is a city district in Stockholm, Sweden. </p>\n<h2>History</h2>\n<p>Norrmalm is a part of the larger borough of Norrmalm (<em>Norrmalms stadsdelsområde</em>). The southern part of the district, Lower Norrmalm (<em>Nedre Norrmalm</em>), also known as the City, constitutes the most central part of Stockholm, while Upper Norrmalm (<em>Övre Norrmalm</em>) is more residential.</p>\n<p>The name Norrmalm is first mentioned in 1288. In 1602, Norrmalm became an independent city with its own mayor and administration called the Northern Suburb (<em>Norra Förstaden</em>). The town was short-lived, and in 1635 it was incorporated with Stockholm again. Norrmalm is today considered to be the central part of Stockholm.</p>\n<h2>Redevelopment of Norrmalm</h2>\n<p>In the 1950s and 1960s, large parts of Lower Norrmalm were torn down to build a new and modern city. The demolitions were carried out swiftly, and many Stockholmers still miss \"old Klara\" (Klara is a part of Lower Norrmalm). Among the new features created as a result of the clearances were the large central public plaza at Sergels torg and the Klara Tunnel (<em>Klaratunneln</em>). </p>",
