It originally showed vaudeville but was changed to an arts venue around the mid-1880s. Under the leadership of Ernst Eklund 1917-1926 there was a successful blend of revues, classic dramas and debate. In its last years it was used as an alternative venue by the Swedish Royal Opera.</p>\n<p>The building was demolished in 1965 as part of a wholesale redevelopment of the Norrmalm district.</p>",
