An official attempt to name the street <em>Konungsgatan</em> (\"The Kings Street\"), a name known from 1637, obviously failed. The southern part of the street dates back to before the fire.</p>\n<p>At number two is the Bergstrahl House, originally built in the 1640s by Erik Ryning, member of the regency of Queen Christina, and designed by Simon de la Vallée. In the 18th century it was owned by Secretary Gottfried Sack who ran a tavern and a brothel there, which was frequented by the troubadour Carl Michael Bellman, the authors and poets Karl Israel Hallman and Olof Kexél. When Sack died in 1774, Hallman delivered an oration to his memory, which became the starting point for the order Par Bricole, a society which is still devoted to cultivating and preserving Swedish cultural heritage, especially that from the 18th century. The building was thereafter the location for newspapers and social clubs associated with the dawning Swedish democracy. Lately the address has been used by state institutions such as the Supreme Court.</p>",
