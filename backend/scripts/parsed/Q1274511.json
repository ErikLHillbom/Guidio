All six of the Picasso paintings and one of the Braque paintings have been recovered.</p>\n<h3>Pontus Hultén Collection</h3>\n<p>In 2005, former museum director Pontus Hultén bequeathed over 700 works of art to Moderna Museet, along with his archive and library. A few works of the collection are on display with the museum's permanent collection; many others are exhibited in the purpose-built Pontus Hultén Study Gallery.</p>\n<h3>Sculpture park</h3>\n<p>The museum has a sculpture park on the island with works by sculptors of diverse nationalities.</p>\n<ul><li><em>The Four Elements</em>, Alexander Calder, 1961</li> <li><em>Le Paradis fantastique</em>, Jean Tinguely and Niki de Saint Phalle, 1966</li> <li><em>Déjeuner sur l'herbe</em>, Pablo Picasso and Carl Nesjar, 1962</li> <li><em>Monumentalfigur</em>, Christian Berg, 1927</li> <li><em>Monument över den sista cigaretten</em>, Erik Dietman, 1975</li> <li><em>Lenin Monument April 13th 1917</em>, Björn Lövin, 1977</li> <li><em>Mannen på templet</em>, Bjørn Nørgaard, 1980</li> <li><em>Svart svensk granit</em>, Ulrich Rückriem, 1981</li> <li><em>Pavilion Sculpture II</em>, Dan Graham, 1984</li> <li><em>Louisa</em>, Thomas M.
