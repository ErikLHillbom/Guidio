Connecting Västerlånggatan to Stora Nygatan, it forms a parallel street to Helga Lekamens Gränd and Ignatiigränd.</p>\n<h2>History</h2>\n<p>The alley is named after a man without renown, Göran Hälsinge, son to Nils Hälsinge and Appolonia Larsdotter. When King Eric XIV's (1533–1577) was still two years old, his mother, the first consort of King Gustav Vasa Catherine of Saxe-Lauenburg (1513–1535), died unexpectedly, and as Appolonia assisted the royal family as wet nurse she was rewarded a house in the alley, later named after her son. The alley is mentioned as <em>Niels Helsingz grend</em> in 1584, and as <em>Jörenn Helssingz grendh</em> in 1588, but was probably commonly referred to as simply <em>Helsingz grenden</em> (1553).</p>\n<p>In his 31st epistle, the troubadour Carl Michael Bellman (1740–1795) gives a hint the alley was associated with prostitution:</p>",
