  "text": "<h1>Överskärargränd</h1>\n<p><strong>Överskärargränd</strong> is an alley in Gamla stan, the old town in central Stockholm, Sweden. Stretching from Västerlånggatan to Stora Nygatan passing on the south side of Gåstorget, it forms a parallel street to Gåsgränd and Sven Vintappares Gränd.</p>\n<h2>History</h2>\n<p>The alley was named <em>Erik Ingemundssons gränd</em> (\"Alley of Erik Ingemundsson\") in 1619, in reference to the mayor (1581–1622) who owned a property in the alley. While the present name appears in historical records as <em>Öfwerskiärare gränden</em> in 1684, and a certain <em>Absalon överskärare</em> is mentioned in 1643 as having bought a property near that of the mayor, it remains uncertain which of the masters of the trade gave his name to the alley. Notwithstanding, an <em>överskärare</em> was an occupation which could be translated to \"wool cloth finisher\", a man who would go over carded wool with a pair of scissors to remove upstanding hairs in order to make the cloth perfectly smooth, masters of the trade being merchants with their own workshops.</p>",
