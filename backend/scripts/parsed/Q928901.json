  "text": "<h1>Köpmangatan</h1>\n<p><strong>Köpmangatan</strong> (Swedish: \"The Merchant Street\") is a street in Gamla stan, the old town of Stockholm, Sweden. A parallel street to Trädgårdsgatan, it stretches from the central square Stortorget to Köpmantorget, intercepted by Trädgårdstvärgränd, Skeppar Olofs Gränd, Peder Fredags Gränd, Själagårdsgatan, Staffan Sasses Gränd, Baggensgatan, and Bollhusgränd.</p>\n<h2>History</h2>\n<p>First mentioned in Latin in 1323 as <em>in medio vici dicti køpmannagatu</em> (\"on the street called <em>køpmannagatu</em>\"), the street served the merchants of Stockholm during the Middle Ages, and was the main connection between Stortorget and the fish market outside the eastern wall. One of the city's medieval gates, <em>Köpmanporten</em> (\"The Merchant's Gate\"), was once found in the eastern end of the street, until it was demolished in 1685. Sometimes called <em>Köpmanvalvet</em> (\"The Merchant's Vault\"), the gate vault stretched across the street, thus connecting the blocks south and north of it and supported a two-story building.</p>",
