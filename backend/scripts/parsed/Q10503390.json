The southern part of the site is dominated by the large corner house. It was built in 1914 for the private railway company Stockholm–Roslagens Järnvägar after drawings by architect firm Hagström &amp; Ekman. For most of the 20th Century, this was the terminal station for trains at the tramway Djursholmsbanan, a part of the Roslagsbanan rail system. Between 1885 and 1960 Djursholmsbanan and Roslagsbanan had their terminus here.</p>\n<p>59°20′15″N 18°04′14″E﻿ / ﻿59.33750°N 18.07056°E﻿ / 59.33750; 18.07056</p>",
