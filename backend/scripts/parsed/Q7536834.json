  "text": "<h1>Skräddargränd</h1>\n<p><strong>Skräddargränd</strong> (Swedish: \"Tailor's Alley\") is an alley in Gamla stan, the old town in central Stockholm, Sweden. Stretching from Västerlånggatan to Stora Nygatan, it forms a parallel street to Bedoirsgränd and Tyska Brinken.</p>\n<h2>History</h2>\n<p>The alley was named after the tailor's guild which occupied number 2 between 1627 and 1842. Part of the building then served as the <em>Förgylta Drufvan</em> (\"Gilded Grape\") tavern sanctioned by King Gustavus Adolphus. The alley was known as <em>Bredgränd</em> (\"Wide Alley\") at the end of the 15th century, a name shared by several other small alleys in the old town, and explained by its slightly larger width compared to the numerous small alleys north of it.</p>",
