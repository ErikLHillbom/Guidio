It forms a parallel street to Drakens gränd, Lilla Hoparegränd, Pelikansgränd, and Gaffelgränd.</p>\n<p>In appears in historical records as <em>Ferkens grändh</em> in 1619, <em>Farkens grändh</em> in 1621, and <em>Bredgränd</em> (?).The alley derives its name from a simple restaurant in the early 17th century found in the eastern end of the alley. It was called <em>Farken</em> or <em>Ferken</em>, a name derived from the German word <em>Farch</em> or <em>Ferkel</em> meaning 'pig', and it probably had a sign displaying a pig. A <em>Leuisa i Farken</em> (\"Louise in the Fark\") mentioned in 1602, was married to a Michill Wossin, who in June 1605 was allowed to run the tavern by King Charles IX. The establishment was however declared unfit in 1687 and the building demolished a few years later.</p>",
