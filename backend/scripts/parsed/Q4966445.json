  "text": "<h1>Regeringsgatans bro</h1>\n<p><strong>Regeringsgatans bro</strong> (<em>The bridge of Regeringsgatan</em>) or more correctly <strong>Regeringsgatans viadukt över Kungsgatan</strong> (<em>Bridge of Regeringsgatan over Kungsgatan</em>) is a bridge in central Stockholm, Sweden, taking the street Regeringsgatan over Kungsgatan. It was inaugurated in 1910.</p>\n<h2>Description</h2>\n<p>The bridge is a combined arch and beam bridge made of three reinforced concrete beams vaulted underneath and resting on two supports. Its vertical sides dressed in granite, the bridge is 11.1 metres wide with a 6.7 metres wide roadway. In contrast to the parallel bridge Malmskillnadsbron, the Bridge of Regeringsgatan is using three arches to cross Kungsgatan; the central span, 14.5 metres in length, passes over the roadway below; while the two spans on it sides, 5.5 metres in length, passes over the pavements of Kungsgatan. The unwieldy intermediate supports makes effective usage of the street width below impossible, and substituting the present construction have therefore been suggested.</p>",
