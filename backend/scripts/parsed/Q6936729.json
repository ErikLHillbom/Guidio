  "text": "<h1>Munkbrogatan</h1>\n<p><strong>Munkbrogatan</strong> is a street in the western part of Gamla stan, the old town in central Stockholm, Sweden. Stretching south between Munkbron and Mälartorget squares, it forms a parallel street to Munkbroleden and Lilla Nygatan, crossed by Yxsmedsgränd, Kåkbrinken, and Schönfeldts Gränd.</p>\n<p>Named after the square at the northern end (which, in turn, was named after the Greyfriars abbey once located on Riddarholmen), the street is, together with the neighbourhood, a product of the reconstruction of the western part of the old town following a major fire in the 17th century. It appears in historical records as <em>Munkbrohamnsgatan</em> (\"Munkbro Harbour Street\") in 1664 and under its present name in 1691.</p>\n<p>The street surface was cobbled in 2003–2005, thus replacing the asphalt of the roadway and the concrete slabs of the pavements.</p>",
