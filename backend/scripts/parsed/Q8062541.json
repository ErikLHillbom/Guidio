  "text": "<h1>Yxsmedsgränd</h1>\n<p><strong>Yxsmedsgränd</strong> is an alley in Gamla stan, the old town in central Stockholm, Sweden.</p>\n<p>Stretching south from Västerlånggatan to Stora Nygatan, it forms a parallel street to Didrik Ficks Gränd and Kåkbrinken and is crossed by Lilla Nygatan and Munkbrogatan.</p>\n<p>Throughout its history it appears under various names : <em>Yskemes grenden</em> (1612), <em>Öskiemyss gränden</em> (1623), <em>Yxe Smedes Grenden</em> (1646), <em>Yxe-Smeds gr</em>[<em>änd</em>], <em>Ödesgr</em>[<em>änd</em>], <em>Uttermarks gr</em>[<em>änd</em>] (1733), <em>Yxsmedsgränd</em> (1885).</p>\n<h2>History</h2>\n<p>The present name is a corruption of the original <em>Yskemes grenden</em>, probably meaning \"The Alley of [Jöran] Yskemes\", mentioned as \"the late <em>Jörenn Yschemesses</em>\" in 1606 and said to have owned a property in the alley. Other than leaving a widow called Marie, little is known about him. The name can arguably be of Estonian or Finnish origin, originally meaning <em>öitsi-mees</em>, \"night watchman\" (e.g. over cattle). The part of the alley between the two Nygatan streets was however called <em>Herr Amunds gränd</em> (\"Alley of Mr. Amund\") as early as 1593, a name which appears as late as 1622. The names <em>Hans Skuttes gränd</em> and <em>Olof Skottes gränd</em>, are recorded in 1557 and 1589, and might refer to the same alley. In 1684, the part below Lilla Nygränd was named <em>Uttermarksgränden</em> after the accountant Daniel Benktsson Uttermark who owned a property there. The uppermost part of the alley between Västerlånggatan and Stora Nygatan, the part originally called Yskemes gränd, is referred to as <em>Sigfrid Olofssons gränd</em> in 1589 and 1621 while a property there is referred to as <em>Yskemetshuset</em> (\"house of Yskemet\") in 1616 and 1618. The name then appears in various forms during the middle of the century, the corrupted version dominating historical documents by 1673. On a map dated 1733 the alley is still divided into three parts with individual names - Yxsmedsgränd being used exclusively for the upper part - only to get united as Yxsmedsgränd in 1885.</p>\n<h2>Song</h2>\n<p>The street features in Carl Michael Bellman's song <em>Fredman's Epistle</em> no. 28, \"I går såg jag ditt barn, min Fröja\", when the muse Ulla Winblad, who lives there, flees from the police. The song begins with the lines</p>\n<blockquote><p>I går såg jag ditt barn, min Fröja,<br/>I Yxsmeds gränd<br/><br/>\"Yesterday saw I thy child, my Freya<br/>In Yxsmeds alley\"</p></blockquote>",
