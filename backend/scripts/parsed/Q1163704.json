  "text": "<h1>Tunnelgatan</h1>\n<p><strong>Tunnelgatan</strong> (Tunnel Street) is a street in Stockholm, Sweden, which stretches from Sveavägen to the Brunkeberg Tunnel.</p>\n<p>Tunnelgatan was named after the Brunkeberg tunnel which opened in 1886. The previous name was <em>Barnhus trädgårdsgata</em> (Orphanage garden street), after the orphanage at Norra Bantorget. During the 17th century, there was a ropewalk at the place. The only remaining residential building in the street is located at the crossing of Tunnelgatan and Luntmakargatan and was built between 1894 and 1896.</p>\n<p>Tunnelgatan is associated with the murder of Olof Palme, which occurred near the tunnel mouth on Sveavägen street, and the killer fled up the stairs. A section of the street has since been renamed as Olof Palmes gata.</p>\n<p>The City Plan 67 intended to expand Tunnelgatan to a six-lane urban highway with continuation through David Bagares gata to Stureplan, and further through Humlegårdsgatan to Norra Djurgården. In the west, a connection to Klarastrandsleden via a bridge over the tracks north of Stockholm Central Station was planned. However the plans were shelved indefinitely when the 1977 City Plan was formulated.</p>",
