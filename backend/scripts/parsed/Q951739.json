The train cars contain 4 seats with 2 on each side. When navigating the course, the trains are free to spin and flip. In 2011, a similar roller coaster, Green Lantern: First Flight, opened at Six Flags Magic Mountain.</p>\n<p>After the deadly incident on <em>Inferno</em> at Terra Mítica in Benidorm, Spain on 7 July 2014, and because the two rides share several similarities, Gröna Lund had ceased running <em>Insane</em> for several days before reopening the coaster.</p>",
