It is accessible by foot from Kungsträdgården, past the Grand Hôtel and Nationalmuseum, by bus number 65, or by boat from Slussen, Djurgården or Nybroplan.</p>\n<p>Positioned strategically at the Baltic Sea entrance to Stockholm, it has traditionally been the location of several military buildings. Today, the military presence is low, and several museums can be found there instead, such as the Museum of Modern Art (<em>Moderna museet</em>), the main modern art museum of Stockholm, the architectural museum in the same building, and the East-Asian museum (<em>Östasiatiska Muséet</em>). It is also home to the Teater Galeasen. On the southern shore is the old sailing ship <em>af Chapman</em> which is now used as a youth hostel. Stockholm Jazz Festival is a popular annual summer event held on Skeppsholmen.</p>\n<p>Eric Ericsonhallen (formerly Skeppsholmen Church) was the venue for an official dinner for foreign royalty, celebrating the Wedding of Victoria, Crown Princess of Sweden, and Daniel Westling in June 2010.</p>",
